### Native song runtime checkpoint — 2026-10-11

Draft [PR806](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/brickwright-lite/pull/806), tested
code117a5b31230ae282aa4adee89bed2ab627fc0a6d, stacked normally on PR804.
Retained MIT PXT instrument/song/TypeScript sequencer now queues real sound,
with clock-driven playback, malformed/mutable-buffer refusal and empty-track
handling. 29 affected checks plus HEAD mirrors pass; four actual original
simulator song controls match active instruction bytes, accounting explicitly
for zero terminal padding. Headless evidence does not qualify audible output.
Version0/hardware-path single-current-song behavior only. Conversion reporter,
shared pseudocode word, import/export/SB3 and song editor remain open; census
unchanged142/41/1. Hosted checks pending. Separate parentSPIKEpinassertion
repair/requalification is on8034e7fcfff8 and normally merged8049e0456303.
No peer placement, PR794 history or engine pins changed. Follow the song
implementation checkpoint in PR806 ARCADE-AGENT-HANDOFF.md.
