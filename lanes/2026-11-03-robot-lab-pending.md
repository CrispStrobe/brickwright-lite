# Robot Lab — pending qualification tasks (unowned)

Status: Q1–Q5 DONE (2026-11-09). Next batch R1–R7 and engine task E1 are
OPEN and unowned (2026-11-10); details in handoff section 00000.

The full task list with exact steps is section 00 of
`docs/ROBOT-LAB-QUALIFICATION-HANDOFF-20261028.md`:

- P1–P6 all DONE (2026-11-08): #1641, #1639, #1669, #1672, #1671, #1668.
  Promoted this round: Afterturn, Toggle Press, Footfall, Phasekeeper,
  Vector Sum, Paired Door Sync, Helixgate.
- Q1–Q5 all DONE (2026-11-09), landed together in #1683 (merge `98067ba8`),
  which also merged #1684, #1681 and #1682. Promoted: Loop Relay, Parity
  Dial, Counter Slide, Point Weaver, Evenhand, RimRun.
  - Manual browser controls, saved-project replay and export not run.
  - RimRun: about 4 % residual, inside the judge's 5 % gate, now explained:
    each roller loses about 0.0085 m/s at each 128 mm track-collider seam
    (about 0.05 mm out of plane, near 74 mm and 202 mm); the judge window
    (2960–3240 ms) covers one crossing (~0.03 of the 0.0327/0.0331 m/s²
    shortfall). Between seams the prediction matches within 0.1 %. Inertia,
    joint friction/damping, timestep and per-part mass ruled out. Judge and
    gate unchanged. Follow-ups not done: single-segment fit, or merging
    abutting track colliders (affects every model). Details in handoff 0000.
  - "Arcade numeric authoring (official build)" was an operator-declared
    exception for that merge. Details are in handoff section 0000.

- R1–R7 (2026-11-10, open): R1 obliquity-orrery (DONE 2026-11-11, #1725); R2 cadence-geneva,
  equinox-differential, helios-transmission, orion-cardan (judge family; DONE 2026-11-12, #1729, except
  equinox-differential: browser manual-control check vs a locked differential, see handoff 00000;
  `lanes/2026-11-11-robot-r2-judge-family.md`);
  R3 apex, aster-governor, vesper-quickreturn, bloom (geometry repairs);
  R4 solstice-pumpjack, tempest-pendulum, impulse-line (start-guard poses; solstice-pumpjack and
  tempest-pendulum re-posed and in review on `lane/robot-r4-start-guards-20261112`; impulse-line stays
  experimental: no gravity-rest pose short of the bob, needs a design change, see handoff 00000;
  `lanes/2026-11-12-robot-r4-start-guards.md`);
  R5 spiral-scribe, quiet-partner; R6 pan-shift, inertia-loop; R7
  vector-delta (blocked by a missing part).
- E1 (2026-11-10, open): Jolt enhanced internal-edge removal for tile-joint
  bumps; diagnose pair order first, then opt-in per model.

Rules: iterate without `ci:full`, add it once on the final head; merge only
with `--match-head-commit` after every enabled check passes; never weaken a
threshold, judge or gate; no force-push or rebase of shared branches.
