# Browser audit runner step outcomes — claim, 2026-10-24

**CLAIM ONLY; merge before implementation.** Owner: Codex CI audit repair,
explicitly authorized to take over this narrow CI boundary. Base:
`5cb3c30b12055e22ddbd027163d4e8285cfd28b0`. Public branch:
`lane/ci-browser-runner-step-outcomes-claim-20261024`. The isolated checkout
and detailed original audit are recorded privately. This takeover excludes
Arcade application/features and every other owner's product work.

[Build40113882924](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/brickwright-lite/actions/runs/40113882924)
at source `2ffb3bb8327053b939cf14bb243c4392253a17e5` retains browser gate PASS
output followed by an unauditable step API snapshot. Completed job envelopes
still contain pending/missing step records after job completion. Unique read
keys and direct job reads already exist; preserve these original failures and
their unchanged legacy refusal. Do not infer a skipped or successful gate from
missing API evidence or replay unchanged failed qualification.

Own exactly these implementation paths after the claim merges:

- `.github/workflows/build.yml` only browser-job step IDs, explicit terminal
  scalar input mapping and selection of the new mode in its final audit step.
- `scripts/audit-job-steps.mjs` and `test/audit-job-steps.test.mjs` for a
  separately selected runner-evidence mode and complete pure controls.
- `scripts/lib/workflow-gates.mjs` only the narrow step-ID parsing and source
  mapping needed by that mode; preserve its existing shard partition behavior.
- `test/browser-gate-shards.test.mjs` only to add complete input/ID/name/order/
  shard mapping closure and meaningful mutations while retaining old tests.
- `test/browser-gate-timeouts.test.mjs` only to strengthen the unchanged
  always-last audit position, conditions and existing limits.
- `CI-POINTERS.md` only a truthful browser audit evidence-mode pointer; preserve
  every other row and every historical census observation.
- `lanes/2026-10-24-ci-browser-runner-step-outcomes.md` only.

No new job or step name is proposed. The workflow source definition changes
through the scoped IDs, scalar mapping and audit mode; stored census snapshots
and their recorded definitions remain historical and byte-held. The narrow
CI-POINTERS update records the evidence-mode change without inventing execution
observations. No classifier, shard reassignment, application, supplier/pin,
native/GUI actual controller or guest change is owned.

Keep the audit inline, exactly once, `if: always()` and last in the browser
job. Preserve every existing preceding command, condition, timeout, dependency,
action pin, permission and existing step ID. Add deterministic unique IDs only
where absent; the current source has 242 preceding steps, 22 existing IDs and 220
missing IDs, including unnamed setup/upload actions. Bind all preceding steps,
not just the gates assigned to the current shard.

Use the documented [GitHub steps context](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/contexts#steps-context)
as the distinct input boundary. Map explicit scalar
`steps[<id>].outcome` and `steps[<id>].conclusion` references only. Never export
`toJSON(steps)`, outputs, secrets or the whole environment. Never substitute an
empty value with `skipped`, `success` or an inferred condition result. Missing
context must refuse, including if the runner cannot supply a skipped record.
Document the before/after `continue-on-error` distinction; this mode must not
convert an unsuccessful gate outcome into successful evidence.

A closed versioned scalar wire may carry exact ID/outcome/conclusion rows,
with checked workflow names and order derived from the source. Bound input to
64 KiB and 512 rows; retain at most 128 KiB of sanitized complete evidence in the
existing job log. Refuse oversize rather than truncate or silently omit facts.
Retain only the mapped fields, source/workflow fingerprint, run/attempt/job/
shard identity and verdict. No new artifact family or transport is owned.

Require an exact one-to-one map to the checked workflow's preceding IDs,
names and order, including companions and unnamed actions. Refuse missing,
empty, extra, duplicate, reordered, malformed or contradictory terminal states
and mismatched source/run/job/shard input. Permit only documented terminal
values. Preserve skipped-in-green, wrong-shard/double-run, unassigned-gate,
partition, real-earlier-failure and missing-record assertions. All old API,
`--file`, direct identity/cache handling and six 10-second polls and refusal behavior
remain held; the new mode never relabels incomplete API evidence as complete.

Before source publication, require full manufactured workflow-context-to-CLI
positive controls for every current shard and coherent negatives for each
boundary above. Exercise actual scalar expressions and source-derived IDs,
not a second hand-maintained gate list. Source mutants must fail when an
expression references another step, an ID/map row disappears or duplicates,
outputs/whole-context/default-state substitution appears, a terminal state
is contradictory, a shard gate runs elsewhere, or old absence assertions are
removed. Prove old functions/tests and all preceding workflow commands,
conditions, IDs and limits remain unchanged except the claimed mapping scope.

Source qualification remains all enabled exact-head checks with declared skips
only. Fresh hosted use must show the runner supplies complete mapped terminal
states; synthetic controls cannot establish that platform availability. Keep
all retained failures, native event guards and unrelated ownership boundaries.
This claim selects no native/GUI event, variable, label, original GET or guest.
