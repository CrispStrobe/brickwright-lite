/* Brickwright PWA service worker.
 *
 * ## The bug this was rewritten to fix (2026-08-09)
 *
 * The first version was stale-while-revalidate for EVERY same-origin GET —
 * `return cached || network` — including `index.html` and the hashed entry
 * bundle. That breaks the app on the second deploy, and it broke it in
 * production:
 *
 *   1. A visit caches index.html and gui.<oldhash>.js.
 *   2. A new build deploys. Chunk hashes change; the old chunk files are gone,
 *      because a deploy replaces the whole tree.
 *   3. The next visit is served the CACHED index.html, which names the CACHED
 *      old entry. The app runs a build that no longer exists on the server.
 *   4. The moment that old entry lazily imports a chunk the user had not
 *      visited before — the C tab, the debugger — it requests a hash that is
 *      404 and fails with "Loading chunk NNN failed".
 *
 * Reported as: `Can't show as c: Loading chunk 596 failed
 * (.../chunks/sb3-creator.fa965b005eea503da2a1.js)`. Confirmed by fetching the
 * deployed entry: it names `sb3-creator.8972d337850ada585ee3.js`, which is 200,
 * and contains the failing hash zero times. The browser was running a stale
 * entry against a fresh tree.
 *
 * Bumping CACHE would not have helped on its own, because nobody bumps a
 * constant on every deploy — and a scheme that needs a human step on every
 * release is a scheme that fails on the release someone forgets.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * **The document is the one thing that must never be stale**, because it names
 * every hashed asset. Everything it names is content-addressed and therefore
 * safe to cache forever.
 *
 *   navigation / index.html  -> network first, cache only as an offline fallback
 *   hashed assets            -> cache first (immutable: the hash IS the version)
 *   everything else          -> stale-while-revalidate
 */
/* v3: bumped after the 2026-08-10 stale-client incident — a browser that was
 * last served by the v1 worker (stale-first documents) kept running a build
 * whose chunks had been deleted from the server, indefinitely. Activating v3
 * deletes every older cache outright, so the first visit after this deploy
 * starts clean even for those clients. */
// v4: a deploy served a mismatched tree, so v3 caches can hold entries for assets that 404'd.
// Hashed assets are cache-first and are never revalidated, so those entries would be permanent.
// The activate handler deletes every cache that is not the current one, which means renaming is
// the only thing that actually recovers a browser that is already broken.
// v4 stands. The 2026-08-30 changes below (a bound on the document fetch, and
// never serving a non-ok cache entry) recover a poisoned browser WITHOUT a
// rename, because both of them route around the bad entry instead of trusting
// it. A rename is still the only recovery for a bug that makes the worker trust
// something it should not — which is why the activate purge exists and why
// `scripts/verify-service-worker.mjs` asserts it.

/** How long a document waits for the network before the cached copy is offered.
 *
 * Network-first has an unstated assumption: that the network either answers or
 * fails. A captive portal, a dropped route or a half-open socket does neither,
 * and `catch` has nothing to catch. The document request then hangs — on a page
 * the browser is holding a perfectly good copy of, in an app whose entire reason
 * for shipping a worker is the case where the network is not there.
 *
 * 3 s: long enough that a normal document (a few KB, no-cache) is never
 * pre-empted on a slow connection, short enough to be under the time a user
 * takes to decide the app is broken. Nothing is lost when it fires — the network
 * request is left running and still refreshes the cache for the next load, so
 * the cost of a false trip is one stale first paint, not a missed deploy.

 * not, and — when nothing is cached — keeps waiting on the network, because a
 * timeout with nothing to fall back to has nothing better to offer than the
 * request that is still in flight. Rejects if the network rejects, which is the
 * caller's signal to try the cache: a network that FAILS is the offline case and
 * was already handled.
