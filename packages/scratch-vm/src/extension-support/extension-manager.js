// id" branch below and every block of the extension stopped working on open.
// Every PINNED gallery id now routes to the gallery's CONTENT-PINNED copy (the
// bytes TurboWarp runs: CrispStrobe/extensions tracks TurboWarp/extensions),
// fetched and hash-checked like any gallery pick, then run in the worker or the
// adapter as its pin says. No copy is bundled here.
//
// The id -> slug map is DATA, not a hand list: each pin's generator-owned

// scripts/sync-gallery-pins.mjs). E3's two entries (Encoding, lmsTempVars2) are
// two of its 128 rows. Bundled and lazy built-in ids are matched first in
// loadExtensionURL, so a gallery copy of an extension Lite bundles never
// replaces the bundled one.

// The parked WIP (23e9c7f44) bundled two partial clean-room re-implementations
// under E3's ids instead. They were not ported: Encoding offered 2 of the 9
// blocks and Base64 only (the URL mode threw; unpadded input the original
// decodes came back empty), and the temporary variables offered 4 of 13 opcodes
// with 0 where the original reports "" and no reset on green flag / stop.
