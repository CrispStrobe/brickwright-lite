/**
 * A GREEN JOB MUST NOT HIDE A SKIPPED GATE.
 *
 * 2026-09-05, twice: a job reported success while a browser gate inside it had
 * been `skipped` — once because an `if:` named a status function and silenced
 * the seventeen steps after it (build.yml's own comments record run 62385f4c5),
 * once because a merge moved steps into a job whose conditions no longer held.
 * Every one of those greens was read, by people, as "the gate passed". The
 * reviewer's remedy has been a per-step audit by hand: open the run, count the
 * browser steps, check none says skipped. This step does that audit inside the
 * job, so the job cannot be green with a skipped gate in it.
 *
 * Runs as the LAST step of the job that holds the browser gates, `if: always()`.
 * It asks the Actions API for this run's jobs, finds its own job, and:
 *
 *   - if any `Browser gate…` / `Browser benchmark…` step ended `skipped` while
 *     NO earlier step failed, fails, naming the skipped steps — that is the lie;
 *   - if an earlier step did fail, prints the skipped list as a note and exits 0:
 *     the job is already red for the real reason, and a second red for the same
 *     cause is noise;
 *   - if it cannot see its own job (API, permissions), FAILS — a check that
 *     cannot see is not a check that passed.
 *
 * SHARDS (2026-09-06). The browser job is a matrix of shards, one body, each
 * gate's `if:` naming the shard it belongs to (scripts/lib/workflow-gates.mjs
 * reads those clauses; they are the only list). With `--shard <name>` the audit
 * judges THIS leg against that list: a gate assigned here that ended skipped
 * is the lie above; a gate assigned elsewhere must show skipped here — one that
 * ran is a double run, failed by name; a gate in this job's steps with no
 * assignment is failed by name; and the partition itself (every gate exactly
 * one existing shard, no shard empty, companions matching) is re-checked from
 * the checked-out build.yml, so a workflow edit that dodges the unit tests
 * still fails inside the job. BW_JOB_NAME carries the leg's display name
 * (`browser (heavy)`), because the API reports that and GITHUB_JOB stays
 * `browser` for every leg.
 *
 * `--file jobs.json` feeds it a saved jobs payload instead of the API, which is
 * how test/audit-job-steps.test.mjs proves each branch above can fire.
