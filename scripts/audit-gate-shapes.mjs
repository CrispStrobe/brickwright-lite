/**
 * audit-gate-shapes.mjs — the mechanical half of the "gates that cannot fail" sweep.
 *
 * sb3-creator's `scripts/gate-inventory.mjs` already finds tautologies, corpus-driven vacuity,
 * filesystem-discovery vacuity, early returns and unguarded sibling skips. This finds a
 * different set: four shapes that were each caught the expensive way — by a defect reaching
 * main — on 2026-09-02, and each of which leaves a signature in the text.
 *
 *   TRUNCATED-CAPTURE   A non-greedy `[\s\S]*?` inside a bracket- or brace-delimited capture.
 *                       It ends at the FIRST closing delimiter, so a delimiter introduced later
 *                       inside the region silently shortens the match. Real instance:
 *                       `generate_handler!\(\[([\s\S]*?)\]\)` stopped at `#[cfg(desktop)]`'s
 *                       `]`, and an assertion that the broker "remains unregistered" was reading
 *                       a truncated string that could no longer contain what it looked for.
 *
 *   SEGMENT-MATCH       `.at(-1)` / `.pop()` on a `split` result, used before a membership or
 *                       equality test. Matching a qualified name by its last segment lets
 *                       `native_broker::invoke` pass an allow-list as `invoke`.
 *
 *   WINDOWED-SEARCH     A fixed-width `slice(0, N)` searched for a guard. If the window is wider
 *                       than the construct, it reads into the NEXT one and a deleted guard
 *                       matches its neighbour's. Brace-match the region instead.
 *
 *   SWALLOWED-PRECONDITION
 *                       An awaited precondition inside a `try` whose `catch` is empty or
 *                       comment-only. The gate neither fails nor skips: it CONTINUES, and every
 *                       later assertion runs against a state that was never established.
 *
 *   SILENT-SKIP         A `continue` or `return` guarded by a condition or a `catch`, directly in
 *                       the body of a loop over a FILE WALK (readdirSync, git ls-files, walk(),
 *                       glob), with nothing within reach that reports it (a diagnostic, a
 *                       counter, a push to a skipped list, a console line). A predicate on the
 *                       NAME alone (extension, basename) is a role skip and is not this rule's
 *                       business; a skip on content or on the filesystem's answer is, and the
 *                       two are told apart: unreadable (NUL, size, parse) wants its skipped set
 *                       REPORTED; absent (existsSync) wants "was it supposed to be there?"
 *                       ASSERTED, because absence is usually the finding (lego-be). The set is a
 *                       set the gate does not quantify over, and nothing in the run says so:
 *                       T9's `if (text.includes(NUL)) continue;` reported CLEAN for as long as
 *                       one file held a NUL, while a former pin sat inside it (lego-be, 2026-09-07).
 *
 *   EVENT-AS-STATE      A visibility/appearance assertion (`waitFor`, `toBeVisible`, a `count()`
 *                       compared against a positive number) in a file that never asserts the
 *                       same thing is ABSENT. Appearance is a transition; most of these defects
 *                       live in the steady state afterwards. bw-ci's formulation: an assertion
 *                       about an event silently taken as an assertion about a state.
 *
 * Every hit is a SUSPECT, not a verdict — the point is to shorten the reading list. Exit is 0
 * unless --strict is passed, so this reports rather than blocks until its findings are triaged.

//
// This tool ranges over test/ and scripts/. The goal it appears to serve --
// "find gates that cannot fail" -- ranges over gates, which is not the same
// set, and the difference was invisible because the summary never said which
// set it had walked. lego-a4's census and my vendor sync failed the same way
// on the same day; the general form is the coverage lane's:
//
//   A success message quantifies over some SET, and is trustworthy only when
//   that set equals the set the GOAL cares about.
//
// MEASURED before writing this: --root . finds 15 more SEGMENT-MATCH hits in
// overlay/ and packages/. I read them. They are NOT defects -- they are
// `file.name.split('.').pop()` extracting a file extension, and a deliberate
// basename comparison in sb3-creator-c.js. `.pop()` on a split is a truncated
// membership test in a GATE and an ordinary extraction in source code, so the
// rule is right and the scope is right.
//
// So the fix is NOT to widen the scan. Widening it would add fifteen false
// positives and teach everyone to ignore the tool -- the vacuous widening I
// have caught myself doing twice this week. The fix is that the OUTPUT must
// name the set it walked, so a reader can see the scope is chosen rather than
// assume it is total. An honest narrow report beats a dishonest wide one.
