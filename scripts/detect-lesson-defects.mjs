/**
 * Tier 3 detector — can a lesson checkpoint's observation ever happen?
 *
 * `docs/VERIFICATION-AUTOMATION.md`: reading the corpus one lesson at a time is
 * the wrong shape. Two defects were found by reading seven lessons; there are
 * seventy-nine. Both defects were instances of one class — **the checkpoint asks
 * the learner to observe something the bench it names cannot produce** — and a
 * class is cheap to detect once it is named.
 *
 * The two known instances are this detector's fixture, and
 * `test/lesson-defect-detector.test.mjs` re-runs it against their version-1
 * forms on every test run. If it stops flagging them it is not a detector.
 *
 *   electricity-diode v1     -> 42-diode-rectifier   "Compare input and output
 *                               traces over a full cycle" on a bench with no
 *                               control and no time variation at all.
 *   electricity-capacitor v1 -> 29-capacitor-charge   "Observe voltage and
 *                               current during charge and discharge" on a bench
 *                               whose capacitor voltage never falls.
 *
 * Three checks, reported separately because their confidence is different:
 *
 *   A  OBSERVABLE REACHABILITY — structural, no prose, no judgement. Can the
 *      DOM event a checkpoint listens for ever fire, given what the lesson
 *      loads and what the app dispatches? Zero false positives by construction.
 *
 *   B  DEMAND vs MEASURED CAPABILITY — the prose asks for an action or an
 *      observation; `scripts/bench-capabilities.mjs` says, by solving the
 *      circuit, whether the bench can supply it. Prose matching is a heuristic,
 *      so every finding carries the phrase that triggered it and the bench's
 *      measured capability set, and is meant to be adjudicated, not obeyed.
 *
 *   C  NUMERIC CONTRACT — a quantity quoted in lesson prose must be reproducible
 *      from the bench: present in the example's EXPECTED.md assert block, in its
 *      circuit as a component value, or in the solved node voltages and branch
 *      currents. Catches "teaches a number the bench does not produce".
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT CHECK, stated because a detector that appears to cover more
 * than it does is worse than none:
 *
 *   - whether the pedagogy is sound, or this example the right vehicle;
 *   - prose quality, and the German copy — check B reads ENGLISH ONLY, so a
 *     German translation that demands something different is invisible here;
 *   - which side to fix when a check fires — lesson, example, or engine;
 *   - anything about a lesson whose observation is legitimately off-bench
 *     ("explain in your own words"), which is why a checkpoint with no
 *     `observe` clause is only ever reported under B and C, never under A.
