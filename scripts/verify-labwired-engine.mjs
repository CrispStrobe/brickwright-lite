/** End-to-end proof for the HEAVY simulation tier.
 *
 *  Everything else about labwired is proven by unit tests against the adapter
 *  and by grepping the bundle. Neither answers the only question that matters:
 *  does picking it in a real browser actually run the project's firmware on it?
 *  This drives the GUI — write an STM32F030 program, open the debugger, choose
 *  the engine, run — and then insists the firmware MOVED, because "the panel
 *  said ready" is exactly the kind of plausible-and-wrong this tier has already
 *  produced once (a Map where an object was expected made a dead CPU look fine).
 *
 *  Skips rather than fails when a precondition is genuinely absent: the 20 MB
 *  engine is an optional deploy artifact, and the F030 build compiles against
 *  the remote stc-compiler. A missing engine or no network is not a regression
 *  in this code, and reporting it as one would train everyone to ignore the gate. */
