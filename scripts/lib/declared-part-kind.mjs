/**
 * What kind of part does a pin's DECLARED NAME assert?
 *
 * The seating generator (bw-circuit-ui `model/infer-seated.js`) chooses a part
 * from the pin's DIRECTION alone — analog becomes a potentiometer, input a
 * button, output an LED — and uses the declared name only as a label. So
 * `PIN ldr = P1.3 ANALOG` is drawn as a potentiometer, and the picture
 * contradicts the word the learner wrote.
 *
 * This module says what a name asserts, and NOTHING about wiring. It is
 * deliberately conservative: a name that asserts nothing returns null, and the
 * generator's default stands. Two rules, in order:
 *
 *   1. DERIVED. A name token that IS a footprint kind wins outright. This needs
 *      no table and grows by itself as upstream adds kinds.
 *   2. A SMALL, STATED synonym table for the words learners actually write.
 *      Every entry here is a word, not a judgement about circuits.
 *
 * A name is never a contradiction of a kind it already matches: `declName`
 * "piezo" on a `piezo` part is consistent, and an earlier version of this
 * measurement called twelve of those a defect because it applied the synonym
 * table before checking for agreement.
