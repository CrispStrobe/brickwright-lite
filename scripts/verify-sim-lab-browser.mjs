// The Sim Lab (docs/SIM-LAB-PLAN.md §0) in the SHIPPED GUI build, end to end:
//
//   1. the Robot Lab is its own editor tab (beside Blocks, Code, Circuit): the tab
//      loads the reference driving base from static/sim-lab/models/ with no error
//      issues and a WebGL 3D canvas that actually drew pixels; the SPIKE arena's
//      "Open in Robot Lab" reaches the same tab, and the arena stands aside while
//      the Lab drives the shared virtual hub (one hub, one world);
//   2. a real Scratch program (DEVICE SPIKE pseudocode → blocks, green flag)
//      drives the simulated robot through the virtual SPIKE hub: after Run the
//      hub body has moved forward and the drive motors' encoders have turned;
//   3. with WebGL forced off the pane says so and the simulation still runs;
//   4. the model saved with the project comes back (C8): "Save to your computer"
//      writes the built model's LDraw text into the .sb3's Brickwright bundle,
//      and loading that file restores it byte for byte, both into a Sim Lab
//      opened afterwards and into one that is already open;
//   5. the Build mode works like a CAD editor, driven by real mouse moves, drags
//      and keys only (internal APIs are used to READ results and to find where a
//      part is on screen): a click on the floor places a part under the pointer,
//      a click selects a part, dragging the gizmo's X arrow moves it by a grid
//      multiple, R turns it 90°, the rotate ring turns it, a press-and-drag on
//      the part slides it, Shift+click selects two parts which the gizmo moves
//      in ONE undo step, Shift+drag box-selects, a pin dragged over a beam hole
//      from above snaps in from the top, a beam clicked onto another beam's top
//      rests on it, and a beam pushed into the hub turns red, the status names
//      the hub and the move is refused on release;
//   6. a child's line follower, through the UI only: with no program loaded,
//      choosing the Line follower model offers its example program; the Line
//      Oval mat, "Load example program" (it lands in the Code tab and becomes
//      blocks), Run — and the robot follows the line once round the oval:
//      ≥ 95 of 100 centre-line checkpoints in order, within 4 cm, inside 60 s
//      of simulated time, never more than 5 cm off the line (sim-time waits);
//   7. the Wall stopper, through the UI only: its model, "Load example program"
//      (which also puts it on the Wall mat), Run — it comes to rest 8–12 cm
//      before the wall (its foremost collider point and the distance sensor's
//      ray origin, against the compiled wall's face) and never touches it;
//   8. the Colour explorer likewise on the Colour Zones mat: at rest, its
//      drive-axle midpoint and colour-sensor spot are inside the red square
//      (both judged after a span of simulated time, not wall time);
//   9. seeing the model (scripts/lib/sim-lab-insight-gate.mjs): port badges A/B or "?"
//      in both views, "Show how it moves" draws the hinge axes and body tints in both,
//      unplugging a motor from its badge lists the issue, clicking the issue selects the
//      motor, the "?" badge's picker plugs it back in, and "Before you press Run" warns
//      when no motor is plugged in;
//  10. building instructions (scripts/lib/sim-lab-instructions-gate.mjs): "Instructions"
//      opens step 1 of the driving base with its new parts in the highlight orange
//      and a "parts needed" callout counting them; Next and → / ← turn the pages; the
//      last page is the parts list; "Print / Save as PDF" opens one picture per step;
//  11. a school tablet (scripts/lib/sim-lab-touch-gate.mjs), a 1024×768 touch page and real
//      touch input only: tap a tile then the floor places a part, one finger drags a part by
//      grid steps, drags a tile out of the palette, a long press adds to the selection, a long
//      press then drag on open floor box-selects, a finger drags the gizmo's X arrow, the build
//      bar's Select all / Copy / Paste / Turn ↺ / Undo, one finger orbits and two pinch-zoom
//      (Build and Simulate), and holding ▲ drives with lifting the finger stopping both motors;
//  12. the layout at school-device sizes (scripts/lib/sim-lab-layout-gate.mjs): at 1024×768,
//      1280×800, 1366×768, 1600×1050 and 1920×1080, in Simulate and Build, the 3D view is at
//      least 300 px and half the pane tall, wholly visible with nothing scrolled; Run, Reset,
//      Build/Simulate, Drive ▲, Move/Turn, Undo and the palette are on screen and on top; the
//      pane never scrolls sideways; the palette (a drawer when compact) places a part, Undo
//      takes it away, the compact "More…" menu works, and "open large" goes full screen;
//  13. the build editor's Studio/LeoCAD tools (scripts/lib/sim-lab-editor-parity-gate.mjs, `--part=editor`),
//      real mouse and keys: a colour swatch paints a part (its pixels turn red) and the eyedropper copies
//      a colour, hide / isolate / show all (kept through Simulate), mirror puts a bent liftarm's holes on
//      their mirror images, align lines two beams up, the tape measures 120 LDU between a beam's end
//      holes, a double click edits inside a group, Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V carry LDraw text between models (and
//      from Studio), and ? opens the shortcut sheet;
//  14. big models and model files (scripts/lib/sim-lab-scale-gate.mjs, --part=scale): the 2,054-part
//      stress model opened through "Open…" is ready within 120 s, drawn instanced in at most 150 draw
//      calls and not blank, a frame finishes within 1 s; Build opens on the whole model (ready and drawn)
//      within its budget, an idle frame redraws nothing, a pointer move's handlers stay within budget
//      (hovering and dragging), a click on a grid beam selects that beam and its gizmo X arrow moves it by
//      grid steps (one undo puts it back); the hand-made .lxf opens with its unknown parts listed; a password-protected
//      .io is refused with the model left as it was; "Save as… → .io" downloads a ZIP whose model.ldr
//      is the model's LDraw text and reopens to it;
//  15. the tab, its icon toolbar and the movable 3D view (scripts/lib/sim-lab-toolbar-gate.mjs, --part=ui):
//      every control named, with a tooltip giving its name and shortcut, in English and German; every
//      Build action by click and by key; orbit, pan and zoom by mouse and keys in Simulate and Build, the
//      view buttons, and a drag on a part moving the part, not the camera;
//  16. no page errors;
//  17. connection-first building (scripts/lib/sim-lab-connect-gate.mjs, --part=editor, docs/ROBOT-LAB-UX.md §5):
//      a pin in hand lights the free pin holes and seats in the one under the pointer, with hysteresis,
//      Tab alternatives, a red refusal when blocked, R and [ ] turns, a multi-part group seating both pins,
//      Target-first and keyboard-only placement; the camera orbits and zooms about the point under the
//      pointer, looks from below in Build, eases a double-click focus, and the view cube turns the view.
//  18. the Lab steered from code (scripts/lib/sim-lab-api-gate.mjs, --part=api, docs/ROBOT-LAB-HUBS-PLAN.md P1):
//      a Blocks project of robotlab blocks (saved and reloaded as an .sb3) loads the hubless motor bench and
//      turns its motor 360 ± 2° through runtime.robotLab; the bench's example in `lab` words, through the UI
//      only, turns it 360°, rests there through its wait, runs on at 90 °/s and brakes.
//  19. the LEGO radio hubs (scripts/lib/sim-lab-hubs-gate.mjs, --part=hubs-ble, docs/ROBOT-LAB-HUBS-PLAN.md P3):
//      through the UI only, each example's pup / boost / wedo words become the REAL extension's blocks and
//      Run connects them to the scene's virtual hub (Scratch Link double or Web Bluetooth shim): legopoweredup
//      turns the Technic Hub's motor A 360 ± 2° and back; legoboostunified drives the Move Hub rover ahead and
//      turns it; wedo2unified runs the WeDo rover until its motion sensor sees the wall, and stops it.
//  20. the EV3 and NXT (scripts/lib/sim-lab-hubs-bt-gate.mjs, --part=hubs-bt, docs/ROBOT-LAB-EV3-NXT.md):
//      their extensions reach the Lab's bricks over Scratch Link (the BT-classic registry) — the NXT
//      bumper bot's example (legonxt blocks, UI only) turns both wheels 360 ± 2° and stops on its bumper
//      at the wall; stock Scratch EV3 blocks stop the EV3 wall stopper before the wall on its ultrasonic
//      sensor; the DEVICE EV3 example becomes ev3comprehensive blocks.
//  21. parts from the whole LDraw catalogue (scripts/lib/sim-lab-catalogue-gate.mjs, --part=editor,
//      docs/ROBOT-LAB-ARCHITECTURE.md §5.4.1), against a stand-in mirror: "+" finds, adds and places a
//      part the app does not ship; a sticker joins as decoration; credits name the files; a model with
//      both simulates; both are back after a reload.
//  22. Simulate's speed, Readings, sensor rays and replay (scripts/lib/sim-lab-simulate-ux-gate.mjs,
//      --part=ui), on the Wall stopper: ½× halves simulated time; Readings shows motors A, B and the
//      distance sensor, moving as it drives; the sensor's ray is drawn; paused, the replay slider shows
//      an earlier pose, and Run goes on from now.
//  23. the mats' challenges (scripts/lib/sim-lab-challenges-gate.mjs, --part=ui): the Wall stopper's
//      own program wins "Stop at the wall" (stars, the gap, kept as the best); "Stay in the ring" moves
//      the robot to the sumo mat, where driving straight on leaves the ring and loses.
//  24. the hinge tool (scripts/lib/sim-lab-hinge-gate.mjs, --part=editor): an arm pinned to a beam,
//      N shows its hinge and ] turns it 15° with the arm hanging off it (one undo step); N steps to
//      the other hinge and back; the properties panel's +15°; a turn into a part is refused; a loose
//      part has no hinge.
//  27. pen and paper (scripts/lib/sim-lab-pen-gate.mjs, --part=ui): the driving base's castor ball marked as a
//      pen draws its track on the floor as the robot drives; Reset cleans the floor.
//  26. the coach marks (scripts/lib/sim-lab-coach-gate.mjs, --part=editor): the first Build shows the tips card,
//      Next steps through, the last puts it away for good; "Show the tips again" in the shortcut sheet.
//  25. chains and treads (scripts/lib/sim-lab-chain-gate.mjs, --part=editor): an 8T and a 24T selected,
//      the properties panel's button lays a closed chain of links in one undo step; Simulate couples
//      the gears by it; two gears too close for a chain are refused; round two sprockets it lays a
//      tread, and each sprocket becomes a wheel of the tread's outer radius; then rubber bands,
//      a rope on a winch, and hoses from a pneumatic valve to a cylinder (steps 5-7).
//
// Every Sim Lab here runs its physics in the Web Worker (ROADMAP §4.9): each load
// asserts `window.__bwSimLab.worker === true`, so the line-follower lap, the wall
// stopper and the colour explorer — the checks most sensitive to a step of lag
// between a sensor, an encoder and the motion — judge the worker. The instruments
// sample after every advance of simulated time (session.onAdvance: on the worker,
// when a batch has reached the hub), not inside tick(), which only sends the batch.
//
// Run after the integrated GUI build:  node scripts/verify-sim-lab-browser.mjs
