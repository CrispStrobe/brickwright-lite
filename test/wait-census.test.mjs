/**
 * The browser gates' unconditional sleeping is a number, and it may only shrink.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT JUST A REPORT
 * ----------------------------------------
 * `docs/MEASURED-THRESHOLDS.md` asks, of every number that bounds a verdict,
 * who measured it. `waitForTimeout(N)` is not such a number — it bounds
 * nothing, decides nothing, and a threshold inventory is right to skip it.
 * Which is exactly why nobody has ever had to justify one, and why there are
 * now 261 of them against 153 bounds.
 *
 * A fixed sleep is a guess about how long the app needs, and it is the one kind
 * of guess that cannot be checked by watching: it costs exactly what it was
 * given, every time. Too short is a flake nobody can reproduce. Too long is
 * wall-clock on every CI run forever. The only thing an outside observer can do
 * is refuse to let the total grow silently.
 *
 * So: a ratchet, with the measurement in the source next to it, per the rule
 * that a re-measurement is written back so nobody repeats it.
 *
 * HOW TO CHANGE THESE NUMBERS
 * ---------------------------
 * DOWN, freely — replace a sleep with a wait for the condition it is standing
 * in for (`waitForSelector`, `waitForFunction`), then lower the ceiling to the
 * new total in the same commit.
 *
 * UP only with a reason in the commit message. Adding a browser gate is a
 * legitimate reason. "The test got flaky so I raised the sleep" is the failure
 * this ratchet exists to make visible: it is the cheapest possible fix and it
 * charges every future CI run for it.

// BASELINE RE-MEASURED 2026-08-28 after this branch was integrated into the
// expanded browser-gate workflow, by
// scripts/aggregate-timeouts.mjs --census. Every ceiling here is the observed
// value with ZERO headroom, which is the correct state for a ratchet: nothing
// can be added without this going red.
//
//   run by CI           106 sleeps  116.880 s across 11 browser-gate scripts
//   TOTAL               153 bounds  261 sleeps  426.640 s
//
// The historical 2026-08-24 measurement remains in docs/WAIT-CENSUS.md. The
// increase is the explicit cost of six gates added since that sweep: Arduboy,
// labwired, debugger-only, example selection, micro:bit and micro:bit debug.
//
// EXACT values below, not the report's rounded ones. Setting `ciSleepMs` from the
// table's "61.9 s" made the ratchet red on the tree it was measured against:
// the true total is 61,930 ms. A ceiling read off a rounded display is a
// threshold whose evidence is a formatting decision.
// RAISED 2026-09-22 for the flag-on FPGA surface gate, which is the legitimate
// reason this ratchet names: a gate was ADDED. scripts/verify-fpga-surface.mjs
// existed and was listed in test/gate-coverage.test.mjs as knowingly unwired;
// the new `fpga-surface` job in build.yml runs it, so its sleeps now cost CI
// time and the census counts them for the first time. NO NEW SLEEP WAS WRITTEN
// — the delta is entirely the price of running a script that was already there.
//
// Measured with scripts/aggregate-timeouts.mjs --census --json, on this branch
// and on origin/main with only .github/workflows/build.yml swapped between the
// two runs, so the difference is the wiring and nothing else:
//
//   before (origin/main)  104 sleeps  111,880 ms
//   after  (this branch)  110 sleeps  120,180 ms
//   delta                  +6 sleeps   +8,300 ms   all in verify-fpga-surface.mjs
//
// TIGHTENED 2026-09-23: `totalSleeps` 261 -> 192, closing the note the previous
// change left here. A ratchet with slack is not a ratchet — 69 sleeps could have
// been added repository-wide without a word, which is the exact silence this file
// exists to break. Main drifted DOWN since the 2026-08-28 sweep (sleeps removed,
// and vendor-absent-by-design retired with its own) and nothing pulled the
// ceiling after it; moving a ceiling down to meet the tree is always allowed.
//
// RE-MEASURED on this tree, all four, so no ceiling here is inherited from an
// older shape of the repository:
//
//   run by CI    110 sleeps  120,180 ms
//   TOTAL        192 sleeps  331,030 ms   (590 bounds, 775 files parsed)
//   scratch       10 _tmp- files with waits
//
// Every number below is now the observed value with ZERO headroom, which is the
// correct state for a ratchet: nothing can be added without this going red.
//
// FALSIFIED, not assumed — and the first attempt at falsifying it FAILED, which
// is worth writing down. A bare `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1))` added
// to a test file does NOT move this count: the census counts `waitForTimeout(N)`
// callees and nothing else (scripts/aggregate-timeouts.mjs:132, and its header
// says why that is the right subject). One added `waitForTimeout(1)` does trip
// it — "193 fixed sleeps across scripts/ and test/, up from 192" — so the
// ratchet bites, but only on the shape it claims to be about. A `setTimeout`
// that blocks CI is a different (uncounted) problem.
//
// IF THIS IS WHAT BROKE YOUR BUILD: you added a `waitForTimeout`. The fix is to
// wait for the CONDITION it stands in for (waitForSelector / waitForFunction),
// not to raise the number. If you genuinely added a gate, raise it here in the
// same commit with the measurement, as the FPGA entry above does.
