/**
 * The C tab now has two compilers, and this is what stops that from becoming
 * two bugs — the same job `test/asm-assemble-route.test.mjs` does for the ASM
 * tab, and modelled on it deliberately.
 *
 * The shape is not quite the same, and the difference matters. For assembly
 * the two routes are "in this browser" and "at stc-compiler", and either could
 * in principle serve the 8086. For C there is no choice at all: the hosted
 * service has no 8086 back end (ROADMAP §3.8.2b, door 1 — `ia16-elf-gcc` is
 * not deployed), so the local route is not an optimisation, it is the only
 * road. That makes the "no fallback" rule stronger here than for the 8051:
 * falling back would replace a message naming the learner's construct with
 * `unknown compile target 'i8086'`.
 *
 * THREE THINGS ARE ASSERTED:
 *   1. ONE function decides — `cRouteFor`, and the component calls it rather
 *      than testing the device id itself.
 *   2. NEITHER ROUTE LEAKS. An 8086 C program is never posted (the network is
 *      replaced by a spy that throws for the whole build), and a device with
 *      no local C route is refused BY NAME instead of being handed to a
 *      compiler that emits 8086.
 *   3. THE RESULT SAYS WHICH ROUTE RAN, and carries the slot and profile that
 *      tell the bench a .COM from a ROM.
