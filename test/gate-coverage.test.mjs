/**
 * A browser gate that CI never runs decays into decoration.
 *
 * THE EVIDENCE THIS RESTS ON (swept 2026-08-27, against a current build, with
 * the servers and PROOF_URL each script expects — so these are not setup
 * failures):
 *
 *   17 scripts/verify-*.mjs are referenced by no workflow. FOUR still pass.
 *   THIRTEEN do not. Two more had already rotted and were repaired that day:
 *   verify-debugger-solo could not get past its first click (a starter overlay
 *   it never dismissed, a textarea the editor stopped being, and two button
 *   titles from a UI model that no longer exists), and verify-labwired-engine
 *   was written and simply never wired in.
 *
 * The failures are not interesting individually — they are stale selectors and
 * expired assumptions, exactly what happens to any check nothing exercises. The
 * structural point is that NOTHING NOTICED. Each one was written to catch a
 * regression its author had just been bitten by, and each stopped being able to.
 *
 * So: a new gate must be wired into a workflow, or listed below as knowingly
 * unwired. The list is a ratchet, not a blessing — it should only ever shrink.
 * Adding to it is a deliberate act that shows up in review; forgetting to wire
 * a gate in is not.
