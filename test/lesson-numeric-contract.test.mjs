/**
 * Check C — a number a lesson teaches must be one its bench produces.
 *
 * The whole-catalog run comes back with zero unmatched quantities, and a
 * zero has to be earned. Two things are asserted here so it can be believed:
 *
 *   1. COVERAGE. "0 unmatched" is meaningless without "out of N examined": a
 *      scanner whose extractor silently matched nothing would report exactly
 *      the same clean result. The extractor is tested against a sentence whose
 *      answer is known, and the corpus run is asserted to have examined a
 *      non-trivial number of quantities.
 *   2. MUTATION. Injecting a value no bench produces must make it red across
 *      the catalog.
 *
 * The coverage number is small on purpose and is worth knowing: only 13 of the
 * 79 lessons quote an electrical quantity in their English prose at all. This
 * check therefore protects a narrow seam well and says nothing about the other
 * 66 — which is a fact about how the curriculum is written, not a gap in the
 * check, and it is the reason Check B carries the weight.
