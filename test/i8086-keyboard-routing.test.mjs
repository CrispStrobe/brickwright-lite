// The host half of the keyboard: browser key -> set-1 scancode -> runner.keyIn.
//
// The machine has had the hardware since the support-chip lane wired the 8255
// to the PIC, and the debug target has exposed keyIn() since bw-board 6c0b9f1.
// This is the piece that makes a person able to type: the map, the make/break
// discipline, and the capability gate that decides whether a keyboard is
// offered at all.
//
// It is a SOURCE-LEVEL gate rather than a rendered-DOM one, and that is a real
// limit stated rather than hidden: there is no prebuilt bundle on this box to
// drive a browser against. What it does check is the three things that were
// actually wrong in the analogous paths before — a map keyed on the wrong
// browser field, a break code never sent, and a widget offered on a machine
// that cannot take one.
