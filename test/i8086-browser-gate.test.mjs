    // a `_markReactUpdate` call into that block, splitting the one-liner. The
    // replay still works; only the formatting moved, and lite's suite went red
    // for it.
    //
    // That is species 1 of GATES-THAT-CANNOT-FAIL -- a source-text match that
    // tracks SPELLING rather than behaviour -- running in the other direction.
    // The documented failure is a gate that passes while checking nothing;
    // this is the same defect producing a failure while nothing is wrong, and
    // it costs more than it looks: a red that everyone learns to explain away
    // is how a real one hides.

    // requires the CONDITION and the SETSTATE with anything between them,
    // which is the claim -- a program assembled before the tab mounted is
    // replayed -- rather than a claim about line breaks.
    // SAME BLOCK, enforced by allowing no closing brace between them. A
    // window of "some characters" is not enough: this file has FOUR
    // `machineBooted: true` sites and several `__bwPendingMedia` ones, so a
    // 200-character window matched a different pair and the assertion
    // survived deleting the very line it exists to protect. Caught by
