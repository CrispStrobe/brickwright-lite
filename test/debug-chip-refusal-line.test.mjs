// The debugger's chip-refusal line: the first consumer of the collector.
//
// The chips on the 8086 board have always recorded what they will not do. Until
// 2026-09-05 nothing outside each chip read any of it, so a driver programming
// memory-to-memory left a precise record in a field no consumer ever asked for.
// I8086Machine.chipRefusals() collected them; this is the first thing that
// SHOWS them, which is the half that makes the collector worth having. An
// announcement with no reader is the same silence it replaced.
//
// WHAT IS GATED HERE, and why each is not the others:
//
//   1. A real 8086 program — not a poked field — reaches the panel's model. The
//      test assembles `out 08h, al` and runs it, because "the chip records it"
//      and "a program that does the thing records it" are different claims and
//      only the second is what a learner will hit.
//   2. A clean machine produces NO line. Without this, a model that returned a
//      constant row would pass (1), and the row asserted there would be evidence
//      of nothing.
//   3. The model reads ONLY chipRefusals(). Asserted by construction — a fake
//      machine that exposes the collector and NOTHING ELSE still produces the
//      line — and by source, so the panel cannot grow a shortcut into
//      machine.chips later and keep passing.
//   4. The row shape comes from the imported contract, never a retyped list.
