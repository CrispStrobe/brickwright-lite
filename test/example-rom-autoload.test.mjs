/* An example that ships a ROM boots it — the lite half of D7.
 *
 * sb3-creator's three machine benches used to extract a machine cleanly and
 * then boot with ZERO ROM bytes: the bus extract was never the problem, there
 * was simply no image. sb3-creator now builds and declares them
 * (`files.rom` in examples/index.json). This gate covers the other end: when
 * such an example loads, the tab must actually fetch that image and put it on
 * the established media path, instead of leaving the learner to pick a
 * generic preset out of the loader.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO is restate the rule. An earlier gate in this
 * campaign passed its own rule into the sweep it was auditing, so reverting
 * the code under test left it green. Here the dispatch block is EXTRACTED
 * FROM THE SHIPPED SOURCE and EXECUTED, with fetch and window faked. Delete
 * the block and this file goes red because there is nothing left to run.
