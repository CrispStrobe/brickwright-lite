 * The headless Robot Lab runner (test/helpers/robot-lab-direct-vm.mjs) must run a

 * never makes. The pane puts the VM on bw-sim/sim-clock.js's SimLabClock: the
 * program's time is an integer epoch plus the simulated ms the world has applied
 * (SimLabClock.now()). The runner used FakeClock's Date.now(), which accumulates
 * `now += 33.333…` on a 1.7e12 base and so rounds every frame down by ~8e-5 ms:
 * a `wait` of a whole number of frames ended one frame later headlessly. That one
 * frame flipped Bloom (stage 2 trim, NaN at 17.0 s, encoder 3492.7° at 26.6 s,
 * exactly as in system Chrome) and Rack Decoder (stage 5 comparison-window guard
 * at 73.5 s) from "complete" headlessly to failing in the browser.
 *
 * The expected frame counts are not literals: they come from SimLabClock itself,
 * stepped the way the pane steps it.
