// The example journey: browse, pick a device, see which example you are in.
//
// Three owner-reported defects (Lane U in docs/LANGUAGE-DEVICE-MATRIX-PLAN.md),
// and each one is about a fact reaching the place it is needed.
//
//   U1-1  Picking a device AFTER loading an example left the authored board
//         under a retargeted program. The Code tab already resolves the matching
//         bench and refuses a device the example has no circuit for — but only
//         `if (this._lastCatalogExample)`, which only the importer's own
//         catalogue path ever set. The Examples browser's path left it null, so
//         the check was skipped entirely.
//   U1-2  The catalogue narrowed and annotated by the CURRENTLY selected device,
//         which is chosen after the example. The importer's copy did not merely
//         annotate — it FILTERED, which also made its own "Needs:" label
//         unreachable and its sort comment describe an impossible ordering.
//   U1-3  Loading an example overwrites the PROJECT NAME, and nothing said which
//         example that name came from.
//
// ASSERTED ON SOURCE, because this repo's tests read .jsx as text — no test
// imports a component. So these are structural claims, and the browser gate
// (scripts/verify-example-journey.mjs) is where the behaviour is proved. Said
// plainly rather than implied: this file cannot tell you the UI works.
//
// COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED FIRST. Every forbidden token below now appears in a
// comment explaining why it is forbidden — the fix for U1-2 is documented in the
// file it changed. A rule matching the plain text of what it forbids goes red on
// its own explanation, which this repo has hit three times in two days.
