/**
 * A device-only example is not a broken one, and the surface must say so.
 *
 * `mb05-lesson` ships no circuit file because a micro:bit IS the board. The
 * Circuit tab used to answer that with "lists no circuit file, so there is
 * nothing to place on the board" — a fault report about a state that is correct
 * by design, reached by a lesson that sends learners straight to it.
 *
 * What made it possible is worth stating, because it is not the shape it looks
 * like: the gate and the surface did not hold two DIFFERENT definitions of
 * "device-only". `test/declared-pins-wired.test.mjs` had one and the surface had
 * NONE — it tested file presence alone. So the fix is not a flag on the entry
 * (mb05-lesson qualifies through `authored`, and setting `deviceOnly: true`
 * would change nothing); it is one predicate, imported by both.
