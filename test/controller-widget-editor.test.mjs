/**
 * THE WIDGET EDITOR'S REMOVE CONTROL, ITS BOX, AND THE BINDING TOGGLE.
 *
 * Four defects the owner reported from using the app, three of which turned out
 * to share machinery.
 *
 * THE REMOVE BUTTON NEVER FIRED. Not a missing handler: the wiring was complete
 * and correct all along -- onRemove -> _removeWidget -> panel.removeWidget,
 * which deletes and emits. It was dead because the widget card's own wrapper
 * takes POINTER CAPTURE in beginDrag, so pointerdown on the button delivered
 * pointerup to the wrapper and no click was ever synthesised. A button present,
 * styled, wired, and unpressable.
 *
 * The file already knew the remedy: the inspector panel carries
 * `onPointerDown={e => e.stopPropagation()}` for exactly this reason. So this
 * was a known hazard applied to one control and not another, which is why the
 * source assertion below is about the GUARD rather than about the click -- a
 * DOM-level click test would prove today's markup, while the guard is the thing
 * that must not be dropped by the next person who edits this card.
 *
 * THE BOX CHANGED SIZE BETWEEN MODES, for content-sized widgets only. The
 * wrapper takes `width: L.w || undefined`, so a widget with an explicit size was
 * never affected -- 59 of the 88 widgets in the shipped controller examples
 * carry one. The other 29 do not, and for those an edit-only row in normal flow
 * made the card taller in Edit than in Play, so a panel arranged in one mode
 * shifted in the other. The parity test below therefore uses a CONTENT-SIZED
 * widget on purpose: an explicitly sized one passes trivially and proves
 * nothing.
 *
 * THE BINDING LINE HAD NO TOGGLE. The flag itself is panel-level and lives in
 * the serialised shape, which belongs to bw-board: it landed there as
 * `hideBindings`, with its own round-trip gate written against that panel's
 * history of losing `mode` from toJSON for a year. It arrived here with the pin
 * bump, and the control is wired as of that commit -- until then it was
 * deliberately absent, because a checkbox calling a method the vendored copy
 * did not have would have been a control that throws when pressed.
 *
 * What is asserted HERE is the wiring: the view reads the flag, hides the line,
 * and the control reaches the panel. The serialised behaviour is upstream's and
 * is gated there.
