/**
 * THE PIN-MOVE CHAIN ENUMERATES ITSELF (plan T9).
 *
 * A vendor pin bump must regenerate every document that carries the pin —
 * on 2026-09-07 lego-be's bw-board move had to regenerate FOUR (the census
 * snapshot + census-snapshot.js, the matrix doc, the ROM provenance, the 8086
 * capability report) and the fourth was found by CI, not by any checklist.
 * Keeping a checklist is keeping a second list. This test derives the set:
 * no tracked file may carry a full 40-hex sha of a bw-board, sb3-creator or
 * bw-circuit-ui commit other than the CURRENT pins in vendor-pins.json.
 *
 * Two sources of "a sha of theirs", each with its own reach:
 *   1. PREVIOUS PIN VALUES, from `git log -p -- vendor-pins.json` — every sha
 *      the file ever held. Runs wherever the pins file's history is present;
 *      a checkout too shallow to hold it (CI's default depth-1) is refused BY
 *      NAME rather than passed on an empty set (build.yml deepens the history
 *      without blobs before the unit step for exactly this).
 *   2. THE REPOS' WHOLE HISTORY, when a checkout or a bare/blobless clone is
 *      reachable: BW_BOARD_DIR / SB3_CREATOR_DIR / BW_CIRCUIT_UI_DIR (working
 *      checkouts, the convention of bw-board-census and i8086-bios-provenance)
 *      or BW_VENDOR_HISTORY_DIR holding <repo>.git bare clones (what build.yml
 *      makes, ~1 s each without blobs). Unset → that half is SKIPPED by name.
 *
 * Exempt BY ROLE, and why each class is history rather than a reference:
 *   - ledgers (LANES.md and lanes/*, CI-POINTERS.md, HISTORY.md, ROADMAP.md, PLAN.md, BLOCKED.md,
 *     HANDOFF.md): records of what happened; a sha there is dated.
 *   - docs prose (docs/**.md EXCEPT docs/generated/**): narrative cites the
 *     commit it discusses. docs/generated is the opposite — it is one of the
 *     four documents this test exists to keep current.
 *   - comment lines in code (// * # in .js/.mjs/.jsx/.ts/.yml/.sh): notes
 *     beside code, e.g. "pin moved 4134b86 -> ... -> 5d17288" in a test. The
 *     CODE line beside them is not exempt.
 *   - one FIELD by role, and this one is CHECKED, not assumed: the ROM
 *     provenance manifest's `lastTouchedBy.sha` is the bios.asm commit that
 *     last changed the ROM's source. It is exempt here because a different
 *     test owns it — test/i8086-bios-provenance.test.mjs asserts, against real
 *     bw-board history when BW_BOARD_DIR is set, that the manifest's source sha
 *     is an ancestor of the pin and that behindPinBy is the true count. On
 *     main today that field is 7b8d1404, the one non-pin sha outside prose and
 *     ledgers. Every other sha in that manifest must be the pin.
 *   - three exact frozen executable admission constants have source-bound
 *     historical roles, listed in frozen-control-pin-admissions.json. Whole
 *     file bytes/mode/Git blob are independently checked; only the supported
 *     token can keep its shipped previous pin. Other code remains current.
 *     Their old-candidate admission is preserved, never upgraded to a current
 *     qualification by this exception.
 *   - run receipts (docs/receipts/*.json and original model-source READMEs)
 *     are their own role, and it
 *     is NARROWER than a ledger. A receipt is evidence of what was measured
 *     at a named pin (the Doom browser receipt's boardPin is the bw-board pin
 *     it ran against, which a later bump replaced). Rewriting that sha on a
 *     pin bump would falsify the receipt: it would claim a measurement at a
 *     pin nobody measured. So a receipt may carry the current pin OR any
 *     previous pin of a vendored repo. What it may NOT carry is a vendored-
 *     repo commit that was never a pin: that is a receipt citing a source the
 *     lite tree never shipped, and it stays red. The limit, stated: "never a
 *     pin" is only recognisable when the repo-history half runs (the three
 *     *_DIR checkouts or BW_VENDOR_HISTORY_DIR); without it such a sha is an
 *     unknown hex string, invisible here as it is in every other role.
 *   - packages/** is not scanned: packages/scratch-gui/src is a byte-identical
 *     mirror of overlay/ (test/overlay-packages-pairs holds it) and the rest is
 *     upstream Scratch, whose CHANGELOGs carry thousands of shas of their own.
 *
 * What this cannot see, stated: a sha assembled from parts (a prefix constant
 * plus a suffix, a short sha widened at runtime) is out of reach of a by-name
 * scan, the same limit the doc-trigger and ROM censuses carry.
 *
 * Red names the file, the line, the stale sha, the repo, and which pin it was
 * (replaced in which lite commit, on which date) or that it was never a pin.

 * current, finds nothing, and reads as a broken detector.
