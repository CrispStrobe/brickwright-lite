/**
 * The ▶ button now has two assemblers, and this is what stops that from
 * becoming two bugs.
 *
 * `lib/bw-asm/assemble-route.js` argues for the inconsistency; the argument
 * is only worth anything if the three rules it claims are actually true:
 *
 *   1. ONE function decides. Asserted by driving the same `asmRouteFor` the
 *      component calls, and by reading the component to check it calls it —
 *      a route decided in two places is a route that can disagree with
 *      itself.
 *   2. NEITHER ROUTE LEAKS. An 8086 program must never be posted (ca65 does
 *      not have an 8086 back end; the hosted service answers "unknown
 *      assemble target 'i8086'", which is the right answer to a question
 *      nobody should ask it), and a 6502/Z80/8051 program must never reach
 *      the 8086 assembler, which would read its syntax as nonsense and blame
 *      the user's line numbers.
 *   3. THE RESULT SAYS WHICH ROUTE RAN.
 *
 * THE LOCAL PATH IS THE PRODUCTION ONE, not a copy. `requestAssembly`
 * defaults `assembleLocal` to `assembleLocal8086` and this file overrides
 * only the NETWORK. That is deliberate: the repo's named recurring defect is
 * "a test that supplied a precondition production code never supplies", and
 * a gate that injected its own assembler would prove that its own assembler
 * works.
