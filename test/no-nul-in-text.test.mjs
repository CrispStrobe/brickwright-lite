/**
 * NO TRACKED TEXT FILE CONTAINS A NUL BYTE.
 *
 * Found 2026-09-07 by brickwright-lite-ea: test/fetch-pinning.test.mjs held a
 * literal NUL where the two-character escape was meant — the binary-detection
 * check had made its own file binary — which is why grep printed "binary file
 * matches" for lego-be, why git showed UU with no conflict markers, and why a
 * rebase stopped on a file nobody could read. MEASURED, every tracked file:
 * 11,370 files, 1,759 hold a NUL, 1,754 of them binary by format, and FIVE
 * text files — bw-board/board.js (4 NULs) and its packages mirror,
 * bw-circuit-ui importers/easyeda-pro-pcb.js (2) and model/board-lift.js (1),
 * and fetch-pinning (1). ONE SPECIES in all five: a literal NUL typed inside a
 * template literal used as a composite Map key where the escape was meant.
 * JavaScript reads the byte as the same character, so nothing ever
 * misbehaved; the cost is entirely to the tools that read source — grep,
 * diff, merge — which call the file binary. Three of the five are
 * byte-identical to their upstream at the pin (bw-board d5850e6, bw-circuit-ui
 * a879732) and are upstream findings; the fourth is lego-be's one character.
 *
 * Exempt BY ROLE: binary formats by extension — images, audio, firmware and
 * ROM images, WebAssembly, archives, Scratch project/sprite bundles. That is
 * the set of formats the sweep found, stated so a new binary format fails by
 * name once and gets its extension added with its reason.
 *
 * KNOWN carries the four files above with the pin their bytes came from.
 * Every entry EXPIRES: the moment the NUL is gone (upstream fixed and
 * re-vendored, or the test edited), the entry is red as stale and must be
 * removed — a ratchet cannot outlive the defect it names.
 *
 * Two sentences from lego-be, who read the first sweep: git samples roughly
 * the first 8 KB to decide binary, so the same defect was visible to git in
 * one file and invisible in the other — sweep by BYTE, never by symptom. And:
 * a count over the wrong set is a different question, not a smaller answer
 * (the sweep's 1,759 hits are mostly PNGs; the answer is the five). One from
 * the measuring: in zsh, quote every `<ref>:<path>` — `$P:src/board.js`
 * is a history modifier, and git will happily show a different object.
 *
 * Red names the file, the line, the byte offset and the surrounding text.
 * This file itself spells the byte only as an escape.
