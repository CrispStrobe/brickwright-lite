/**
 * The ASM tab's starter programs, and the one thing that makes them worth
 * shipping: they assemble.
 *
 * An empty assembly editor is a wall for anyone who has not written 8051
 * or 6502 before, which is why these exist (ROADMAP 3.3). But an example
 * that does not build is worse than no example — the reader cannot tell
 * whether they mistyped it or it was always wrong, and the tab's own
 * ▶ Assemble & Run is the thing that tells them.
 *
 * So the gate posts every one to the SAME hosted assembler the button
 * uses. That needs the network, so it skips when there is none rather
 * than reporting a pass it did not earn — and the structural checks below
 * it always run.
 *
 * ONE TAB, TWO ASSEMBLERS, so this file covers ONE OF THEM. The 8086's
 * examples are assembled in the browser (`lib/bw-asm/assemble-route.js`
 * argues for why), and posting them here is exactly the mistake the routing
 * exists to prevent — the hosted service answers "unknown assemble target
 * 'i8086'", which is the correct answer to a question nobody should ask it.
 * The split below is taken from `asmRouteFor`, the same function the ▶
 * button uses, rather than from a list repeated here: a second copy of the
 * routing rule is a second thing that can disagree with the button.
 * `test/i8086-asm-examples.test.mjs` covers the local half, and covers it
 * harder — it assembles AND RUNS every one, with no network to excuse it.
