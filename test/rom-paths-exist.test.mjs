// Every `static/roms/<file>` a source file fetches must actually be there.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: debug-runner.js's 8086 branch fetched `bios8086.bin`, a
// name that has never existed in static/roms. It 404ed on every run from the
// day it was written and nothing noticed, because nothing REACHED it — the
// tests construct a machine directly, and the Machine Loader always supplies
// media, so the no-media fallback is the one path a user hits and a suite does
// not. The eighth instance of this lane's recurring defect: a path nothing
// drives is a path nothing tests, and it looks identical to a working one.
//
// A unit test for that branch would not have helped, because the branch is
// correct — it fetches a URL and throws on failure, exactly as intended. What
// was wrong was a STRING, and the only thing that can check a string against
// the filesystem is a check that reads both.
//
// WIDENED 2026-09-07 (lego-ac, from ea's P6 measurement): the first version
// matched only the literal `static/roms/NAME`, and the Machine Loader builds
// `static/roms/${p.rom}` from a PRESET LIST — seven i8086 presets pointed at
// ROMs that were never vendored, the shipped UI 404ed on each, and the gate
// written for exactly that failure could not see them because no line spelled
// the name beside the prefix. The census now also reads:
//   - template literals  `static/roms/${expr}`
//   - concatenation      'static/roms/' + expr
//   - path joins         join(..., 'static', 'roms', expr) / join('static/roms', expr)
// and resolves the variable half through the LIST that feeds it: every
// `rom: 'NAME'` (or "rom": "NAME") property in the SAME FILE is taken as a name
// the constructed path can produce. That is the load-bearing depth of what
// this file can see: a name that arrives from a prop, a JSON fixture, another
// module or a runtime string is out of reach, so a constructed path in a file
// with NO rom: entries is refused by name rather than passed as "nothing found".
// The same limit is stated, not solved: a ROM name assembled from parts
// ('i8086-' + kind + '-demo.bin') is invisible here.
