/**
 * Wave 2 lesson review — "Measure rather than guess", as a gate.
 *
 * Same contract as `test/lesson-bench-claims.test.mjs` for Wave 1: every verdict
 * in `docs/LESSON-REVIEW-WAVE-2.md` is a number that came out of the engine, and
 * this file re-derives it so a verdict cannot quietly stop being true.
 *
 * Wave 2 is the instrument wave, so most of its claims are about whether a
 * reading is trustworthy. Two of them are about a reading that does not exist at
 * all, and those are pinned as OPEN DEFECT tests that fail when someone fixes
 * the engine — the same shape Wave 1 used for the transistor ammeter.
