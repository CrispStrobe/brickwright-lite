/**
 * The ▶ button for an 8086, driven from PSEUDOCODE, with no network.
 *
 * THE ONLY CLAIM WORTH MAKING is the one a learner can check: text in, and
 * the right characters on the screen. So this gate does not assert that the
 * generator emits a particular string, or that `assemble()` returns bytes,
 * or that a promise resolves. It parses pseudocode with the same compiler
 * the tab loads, calls the same `buildPseudocode8086` the button calls with
 * NO injected assembler, boots the result on `createI8086DosBench` — the
 * module `debug-runner.js` imports — and reads the CGA text page back.
 *
 * That shape is copied deliberately from `test/i8086-asm-examples.test.mjs`,
 * which says why: "a test that calls your code generator directly proves the
 * generator works and proves nothing about the button". The repo's named
 * recurring defect is a test supplying a precondition production never
 * supplies, so the only seam overridden here is the NETWORK, and it is
 * overridden with a function that THROWS — a program that leaked onto the
 * hosted route fails here instead of quietly passing.
 *
 * The remaining gap between this and a real click is the React handler and
 * the `bw-asm-rom-ready` hop. Both ends of that are pinned structurally
 * below (the component must call this module, and must dispatch the event
 * with the slot the .COM needs), the same way `asm-assemble-route.test.mjs`
 * pins the hand-written-assembly half.
 *
 * SUPPORTED IS A CHECKED LIST, NOT A COMMENT. Every entry in the back end's
 * `SUPPORTED` table has a program here that uses it and asserts what it puts
 * on screen; every refusal has a program that must be refused, by the tag it
 * claims. A block that quietly did nothing would fail both halves.
