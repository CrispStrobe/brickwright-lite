/**
 * Which assembler the ▶ button uses, and why one tab now has two.
 *
 * THE INCONSISTENCY IS REAL AND IT IS ARGUED FOR, NOT APOLOGISED FOR.
 * Until now every ▶ Assemble & Run posted the editor's text to the hosted
 * service (stc-compiler /assemble — sdas8051, ca65+ld65, sdasz80, avr-gcc).
 * One route, one error surface, one thing to explain. The 8086 breaks that,
 * and the reason is not that nobody got round to it: NEITHER ca65 NOR
 * sdasz80 KNOWS THE 8086. There is no 8086 back end behind that URL, so the
 * choice was never "one route or two" — it was "two routes, or the 8086 has
 * no ASM tab at all". ROADMAP §4.4 recorded that as a decision owed rather
 * than a task pending, and this file is the decision.
 *
 * The case FOR, beyond necessity: where the local route applies it is
 * strictly better. It needs no network, so the button works on a train and
 * in a school that blocks the domain; it is the same assembler the 8086
 * corpus harness runs, differentially checked against MASM 1.10 across 404
 * programs and round-trip-verified against a disassembler that agrees with
 * 646,000 hardware vectors; and it returns a loadable image rather than a
 * base64 round trip.
 *
 * The case AGAINST is the one worth taking seriously: two routes mean two
 * error surfaces and two sets of behaviour to learn. A syntax error from
 * ca65 reads nothing like an `AsmError` from i8086-asm.js, and a user who
 * has learned one has not learned the other. That cost is paid, not dodged.
 * What is bought with it is that the SAME learner can write 8086 assembly at
 * all.
 *
 * THREE RULES KEEP THE COST BOUNDED, and each is asserted by
 * `test/asm-assemble-route.test.mjs`:
 *
 *   1. ONE function decides. `asmTargetForDevice` is the only place a device
 *      becomes a target and `asmRouteFor` the only place a target becomes a
 *      route. The call site does not get a vote, so the tab cannot pick
 *      differently in two places.
 *   2. NEITHER ROUTE CAN LEAK INTO THE OTHER. An 8086 program is never
 *      posted anywhere — the gate injects a `hostedFetch` that throws and
 *      requires it untouched — and a 6502/Z80/8051 program never reaches the
 *      local assembler, which would refuse its syntax with a message about
 *      the wrong architecture.
 *   3. THE RESULT SAYS WHICH ROUTE RAN. `route` comes back on every result
 *      and the tab puts it in the status line, because "it assembled" is a
 *      different sentence from "it assembled here, without the network".
 *      Silence about which of two things happened is the failure mode this
 *      whole codebase keeps paying for.
 *
 * NOT DONE, deliberately: moving the 6502/Z80/8051 targets local as well.
 * That is the change that would REMOVE the inconsistency, and it is much
 * larger — ca65, sdasz80 and sdas8051 are C programs, and lite already
 * carries one Emscripten toolchain (`lib/sdcc-wasm`) whose size is a
 * standing complaint. Recording it as the alternative that was weighed is
 * more honest than pretending two routes were the only shape available.

/**
 * Build the C editor's buffer for a device, and return the SAME shape
 * `requestAssembly` returns, so the ▶ handler that boots an assembly program
 * boots a C one with no second code path.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN THE COMPONENT CALLING `compileC8086`. Rule 1 of
 * this module's header — one function decides the route — was written about
 * assembly and applies unchanged to C. `compileC8086` is the local PIPELINE;
 * it does not know what a device is and must not learn. This is where a
 * device becomes a decision, and it is the only such place for C.
 *
 * NO FALLBACK TO THE NETWORK, and that is a rule and not an omission. The
 * `sdcc-wasm/intercept.js` header states it for the 8051: "a supported request
 * never silently falls back after a local failure: that would turn
 * offline/debug failures into surprising network traffic". Here it is stronger
 * still, because there is nothing to fall back TO: the hosted service has no
 * 8086 C target, so a fallback would trade a message naming the learner's
 * construct for `unknown compile target 'i8086'`.
 *
 * A NON-LOCAL DEVICE IS REFUSED BY NAME rather than quietly posted, for the
 * same reason `requestAssembly` whitelists: the STC12's C already has a route
 * (hosted `/compile`, with `sdcc-wasm` intercepting it) and sending it here
 * would hand an 8051 program to a compiler that emits 8086.
 *
 * @param {{source: string, device: string}} req
 * @param {{compileC?: Function, assembleLocal?: Function}} [seams] passed
 *   straight to `compileC8086`; the tab injects neither.
