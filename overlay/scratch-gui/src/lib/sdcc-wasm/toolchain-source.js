/**
 * Where the SDCC toolchain comes from — and why it is not in this app.
 *
 * SDCC is GPL-2.0-or-later. Brickwright is BSD-3-Clause. Until now the compiler
 * itself was tracked in this repository and `webpack.config.js` copied it into
 * `static/sdcc-wasm/` in the build output, which `tauri.conf.json` bundles
 * wholesale — so the shipping Mac build carried 8.7 MB of GPL binaries inside a
 * BSD-3 application. Measured 2026-09-07 in CI's own github-pages artifact: 101
 * files under `static/sdcc-wasm/`.
 *
 * The binaries now live in their own GPL repository, with COPYING, the written
 * offer of corresponding source, and the SHA-256 of each binary:
 *   https://github.com/CrispStrobe/sdcc-wasm
 * served at the origin below. Nothing GPL is copied into this build any more;
 * the toolchain is fetched only when a user asks for it.
 *
 * THREE MODES, one setting:
 *   online (DEFAULT) — no WASM at all. `localTargetSupported()` returns false,
 *     so `intercept.js` simply does not claim the request and the existing
 *     hosted compiler serves it. This needs no request or response mapping: the
 *     callers already POST to that service for every target this bundle cannot
 *     link, and have since before the local path existed.
 *   local — opt-in. Fetched once from the GPL origin and kept in Cache Storage
 *     so it survives going offline.
 *   dev — the old in-build path, for a web build that still copies the files.
 *     Never the default, and it must never put files in the app bundle.
 *
 * NOTE the honest cost of the default. `intercept.js` says a supported request
 * must never silently fall back to the network after a local failure, "because
 * that would turn offline/debug failures into surprising network traffic". With
 * `online` as the default, the five STC parts that used to compile in-page now
 * need either a network or an explicit opt-in. That is a real regression for an
 * offline learner, accepted deliberately: shipping GPL binaries inside a BSD-3
 * app is not a trade that a convenience can win.

/**
 * THE SINGLE PREDICATE. Is this bundle allowed to compile in-page right now?
 *
 * Until 2026-09-07 two settings governed this, with opposite defaults and
 * different keys, neither aware of the other: `bwLocalCompiler='off'` /
 * `?localCompiler=off` (an opt-OUT, default ON, in debug-runner.js) and
 * `bw-sdcc-toolchain='local'` (an opt-IN, default OFF, here). The result was a
 * SILENT FALLBACK through a second door — debug-runner saw no opt-out, so it
 * installed the intercept and announced nothing; the intercept then declined
 * the request because the toolchain was off, and the compile went to the
 * network without the status line saying so. That is the exact thing
 * intercept.js's header forbids.
 *
 * Order of precedence, and the first rule is the one that matters:
 *   1. AN EXPLICIT REQUEST WINS OVER ANY DEFAULT. Someone who typed
 *      `?localCompiler=off` asked for something; a default arriving underneath
 *      them later must not overturn it. Defaults change, requests do not.
 *      `?localCompiler=on` is its mirror and a direct-link alternative to the
 *      persistent setting in Menu → Settings → C Compiler.
 *   2. A persisted `bwLocalCompiler='off'` is the same request, made to stick.
 *   3. Otherwise the toolchain mode: `local` or `dev` enable it.
 *   4. Otherwise the domain default — see getToolchainMode.
 *
 * Takes the window rather than reaching for it, so the rule is testable without
 * a browser. That is the D-EMU-BP2 lesson debug-runner.js already records, and
 * ignoring it is how CI run 34160645833 went red: a routing decision reachable
 * only through a live session cannot be tested, and a routing decision is
 * precisely the thing that must be.

 * What the download will cost, WITHOUT downloading it.
 *
 * Measured from the live origin on 2026-09-07: runtime.json is 3,286,732 bytes
 * of a 6,737,737 total — ONE FILE IS 49% OF THE DOWNLOAD, and sdcc.wasm is
 * another 27%. Nine equal steps would advance briskly through four small files
 * and then sit motionless for half the total time, which is not an imprecise
 * bar but one that looks frozen exactly when a user most needs telling it is
 * not. Weighting the steps by bytes fixes that and needs no streaming.
 *
 * Sizes are read from the origin rather than kept as a constant here: a
 * hardcoded manifest is a second place stating a fact the origin already
 * states, and it drifts silently the first time the toolchain is rebuilt.
 *
 * THESE ARE TRANSFER BYTES, NOT DISK BYTES, and the difference is a factor of
 * four. GitHub Pages compresses, and a fetch that advertises gzip gets a
 * Content-Length describing the COMPRESSED stream: 1,697,996 over the wire for
 * 6,737,737 on disk. Measuring with `curl -I`, which sends no Accept-Encoding,
 * returns the uncompressed figure and looks like the same number until you
 * divide one by the other — which is exactly what the first version of the bar
 * did, and it reported "2.8 MiB of 1.6 MiB". A progress bar must take its
 * numerator and denominator from ONE of these, never one of each. It is the
 * transfer figure, because transfer is what the user is waiting for.
 * `inspectToolchain` reports the disk figure, and calls it space.
 *
 * IF YOU EVER ADD BYTE-LEVEL PROGRESS BY READING THE STREAM, READ THIS FIRST.
 * A ReadableStream from a gzip response yields DECOMPRESSED bytes, while this
 * denominator is the COMPRESSED length. Counting one against the other gives a
 * bar that runs to roughly four hundred percent — the same mistake as the one
 * this comment exists to record, one layer deeper and harder to see, because
 * both numbers would then be "bytes we counted ourselves". If a trustworthy
 * denominator cannot be had, per-file weighting is more honest than a
 * percentage computed from two different units.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-07, both ways, and reconciled with lego-ac to the byte:
 *   runtime.json  607,272 on the wire / 3,286,732 stored — 81% compression,
 *     because it is base64 inside JSON. 36% of the transfer, 49% of the disk.
 *   sdcc.wasm     452,349 / 1,830,464 — 27% either way.
 *   TOTAL       1,697,996 / 6,737,737.
 * The two largest files are 62% of the wire, so weighting still matters; but
 * "half the download" was true of disk and false of transfer.
