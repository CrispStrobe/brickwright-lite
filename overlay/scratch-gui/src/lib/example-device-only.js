/**
 * Is an example a self-contained DEVICE BOARD rather than one missing a circuit?
 *
 * Some examples legitimately ship no circuit file: a micro:bit or a SPIKE hub
 * IS the board, so there is nothing to place beside it. `test/declared-pins-
 * wired.test.mjs` has always known this — it asserts the equivalence "no
 * circuit if and only if device-only" and computes device-ness from three
 * fields.
 *
 * The Circuit tab did not know it. `circuit-tab.jsx`'s loadExample tested only
 * `ex.files.circuit` and, finding none, told the learner:
 *
 *     "mb05-lesson" lists no circuit file, so there is nothing to place on the
 *     board.
 *
 * That reads as a fault report for a state that is correct by design, and a
 * lesson sends learners straight into it. The two sides did not disagree about
 * the definition — the surface had no definition at all, which is why the flag
 * on the entry was never the fix.
 *
 * One predicate, imported by both, so they cannot drift apart. Note that
 * `mb05-lesson` carries no `deviceOnly` field of its own and qualifies through
 * `authored`; setting the flag explicitly would change nothing here and would
 * only help a human reading the index.
