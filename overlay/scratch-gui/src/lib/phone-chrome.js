/**
 * Give a phone back some of its vertical space.
 *
 * MEASURED FIRST. The menu bar is 48px and the tab strip 44px, so 92px of
 * chrome sits above any content. In portrait that is 39pt of a 930pt screen
 * (4.2%) and does not matter. IN LANDSCAPE IT IS 84pt OF 430 — 19.4%, a fifth
 * of the screen gone before the reader sees anything. Shrinking the two rows to
 * 36 and 34 takes it to 70px: 64pt, 14.8%. Every tab stays clickable and no tab
 * falls below the 32px touch floor.
 *
 * AND IT IS ONE ROW NOW. The menu bar has 509px of free width (its items end at
 * x=481, the next sits at 996) and the tab strip is only 250px wide, so the tabs
 * fit beside them. The first attempt moved the strip with `position: absolute`
 * and DID reclaim the 44px — `panelTop` 92 -> 48 — but the relocated tabs were
 * 0 of 6 clickable. That was not a stacking problem: z-index 492 over the menu
 * bar's 491 changed nothing, and elementsFromPoint showed the tab list absent
 * from the hit stack entirely. Lifted out of its parent's box it was CLIPPED by
 * an ancestor's `overflow: hidden`, which cannot simply be relaxed because that
 * same overflow is what makes the panes scroll.
 *
 * `position: fixed` is the answer, because a fixed box is positioned against the
 * viewport and ESCAPES ancestor overflow clipping altogether. Measured with it:
 * chrome 92 -> 36px, tabs 6 of 6 hittable AND 6 of 6 actually switchable, in
 * both orientations, with zero overlap against the menu items.
 *
 * Two things that had to be checked before trusting it, because a fixed element
 * floats over everything by nature:
 *   - The File menu still opens and its dropdown is reachable (186x312, hit
 *     test lands inside it), so the strip does not cover the menus it sits
 *     beside.
 *   - FULL SCREEN is unaffected: the app already removes the tab strip there
 *     (measured rect [0,0,0,0]), so there is no floating tab bar over a
 *     full-screen stage or widgets pane.
 *
 * A fixed element is also only safe while no ancestor is transformed — a
 * transform makes it position against that ancestor instead. Checked: none of
 * the tab list's ancestors carries transform, filter or will-change.
 *
 * Keyed on the same `data-bw-touch` flag as the tap-target floor, for the same
 * reason: a width media query cannot fire when the layout viewport is 1024 on
 * every phone. See touch-targets.js.

   where the parts rail is open, the editor grew to 942px and the stage column

   client 418), which is how it already behaved, and its right edge is inside
   the layout.
