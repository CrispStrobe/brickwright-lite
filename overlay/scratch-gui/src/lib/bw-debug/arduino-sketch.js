// arduino-sketch.js -- a hand-written Arduino sketch, compiled and booted.
//
// The C tab on an AVR board used to have one thing to do with its buffer: read
// it back into blocks. That reader handles the GPIO subset, and it refuses --
// correctly -- what blocks cannot say: `Serial.println`, `String`, a class, a
// template, `#include <Wire.h>`. So a real Arduino sketch had nowhere to go.
//
// stc-compiler's `arduino` language route compiles exactly that: a sketch as
// the Arduino IDE compiles it, real C++ against the vendored ArduinoCore-avr
// (Uno, Nano, Mega) or ATTinyCore (ATtiny85/88), with the IDE's prototype
// generation and the core's bundled libraries. What comes back is an Intel HEX
// image, and the debug panel already runs an Intel HEX image on avr8js: the
// "Load firmware" path. This module is the join between the two, kept free of
// React so the mapping and the failure classes are testable in Node.
//
// avr-gcc is GPL and cannot run in the page, so this route is HOSTED and says
// so; it never falls back to anything local, because there is nothing local
// that compiles C++ for an AVR.

/**
 * Every device the route serves, keyed by the id the Code tab's device picker
 * uses. `target` is what the service's `arduino` route accepts (it takes the
 * board names as well as the chip names, because the Nano's variant is not
 * the Uno's). `kind` is the debug engine that runs the image -- the same
 * device-to-kind choice debug-panel's syncDeviceKind makes, so a sketch lands
 * on the engine a blocks program for the same board would. `clockHz` is the
 * board's crystal, which the image is built for and must be simulated at: the
 * runner defaults to 16 MHz, and an 8 MHz ATtiny run at 16 MHz would keep
 * perfect time in its own terms while every delay() lasted half as long.
