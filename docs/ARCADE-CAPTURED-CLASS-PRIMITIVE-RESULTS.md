# Captured class primitive results

## Capability and boundary

A class view can prove that an actual field, getter or owned method returns only
primitive values, while the generic graph still treats a captured receiver as
uninitialized. Native addition must compose these separate facts without marking
the receiver initialized or granting an Array producer.

The issuer in `overlay/scratch-gui/src/lib/bw-makecode/native-class-scalar-view.js`
now exposes `hasNormalPrimitiveResult(node)` for exact Conditional nodes it
allocated from already selected accesses. Copies, names, annotations and caller
tags grant nothing. Every carrier, primitive branch and prototype descriptor is
watched. The original access or call remains exactly once as the Conditional test.
Existing constructor, lineage, alias, writer, factory and SDK selection is unchanged.
New method-result delivery also requires actual arity and absence of default,
rest, optional, generic and asynchronous signatures.

The consumer in `native-array-binary-domain.js` tries this result only after its
existing operand admission refuses. It joins the issued carrier, test, branches,
receiver and arguments to the final model. Receiver declaration readiness comes
from the existing lexical frontier; call arguments retain their own obligations.
The complete original effect and Array census still runs. This grants only a
primitive normal result, preserving exceptions and nonreturn behavior. It does
not initialize the receiver, its inputs, method body or an Array/reference cell.
After use, an observed source/carrier/frontier failure permanently revokes the
proof; restoration cannot revive it. The first reflection error is preserved.

## Deliberate remaining boundaries

This is source implementation pending qualification, not full class compatibility
or evidence of a completed corpus application. The original hosted failure drafts
available during this work identify Math.idiv operands, not a class/getter operand.
A real failing class export still needs its exact current input and result captured.

The existing lexical frontier conservatively refuses some class programs,
including method bodies using `this` and certain Boolean/union carrier forms.
This change retains those refusals. A field on a receiver declared before a closed
procedure entry is a separate case from a getter that requires a new method-entry
proof. No source annotation, output tag or guessed callback order supplies that proof.

## Next tasks and acceptance

1. Qualify the complete new
   `test/native-captured-class-primitive-results.test.mjs`, existing class-scalar,
   captured-operation and SDK receiver controls, and all enabled final-head hosted
   checks. Preserve original SDK/native roundtrip fixtures and assertions.
2. Capture exact remaining class failures through the current export observation
   channels. Bind input bytes, source/build identity and result; unavailable capture
   remains unavailable. Do not infer the failed graph from an earlier saved file.
3. Scope class-method declaration readiness separately before changing
   `lexical-declaration-readiness.js`: recognize a genuine method-owned `this`,
   retain global/foreign reflection refusals, constructor reentry, early virtual
   calls, all entries and arguments. Prove receiver declaration completion before
   any captured read. Audit the parser/private-view Boolean representation at that
   same boundary; do not relax all Boolean validation.
4. Verify visible authoring independently. Create and initialize a Counter in Code
   and Blocks; read and edit its fields from a captured procedure and actual event
   callback; edit constructor values; save/reopen; inspect current exported source
   and actual runtime values. Repeat for getters/methods after their frontier is
   supported. Connected blocks and visible source must agree. Graphics/Image/Sprite
   reference fields need their separate storage and editor capabilities.
5. Run complete original/import/Code/same-and-fresh SB3/current-export/reimport
   journeys and genuine corpus applications before changing completion counts.
