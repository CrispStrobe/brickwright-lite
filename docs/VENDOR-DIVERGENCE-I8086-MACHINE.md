# `bw-board/i8086-machine.js` has diverged BOTH WAYS

Discovered 2026-09-04 while trying to vendor the NE2000 into lite.

    lite has that upstream does not:   165 lines
    upstream has that lite does not:    84 lines

**`npm run sync:bwboard` would DELETE the 165.** The tool says so itself and
refuses to guess — *"A difference can mean the vendored copy is BEHIND
upstream, or AHEAD of it, and this comparison cannot tell which."* It is right,
and this file is the case it was warning about.

## What each side has

**Lite-only — a host-renderer optimisation nobody has upstreamed.**
`displayRevision`, a monotonic token bumped on visible VRAM and CRTC-register
writes rather than on every instruction, so the renderer can skip repaints. It
is real work, it is not in bw-board, and **a sync deletes it silently** — the
machine still constructs, the screen just repaints on every frame again and
nobody notices until someone profiles.

**Upstream-only — three things, all landed on master today.**
The NE2000 chip kind and its `REGS` entry; the port-conflict check; and
lego-a4's expanded comment on why the advance schedule must stay lazy.

## What was done, and what was not

**Grafted by hand into lite:** the NE2000 wiring and the port-conflict check.
Both are small, purely additive, and were written by the person doing the
grafting — which is the only reason it was acceptable. Verified afterwards that
`displayRevision` survived, that an NE2000 constructs, and that a conflicting
board is refused.

**NOT done: the reconciliation.** `displayRevision` should be upstreamed to
bw-board so this file can be synced normally again. I did not do it because **I
do not know why it diverged** — whether it is finished, whether the renderer
contract it serves is settled, or whether bw-board's other machines want the
same token. Guessing at someone else's design in a shared file is how the
divergence got here.

## Until then

- **Do not run a plain `sync:bwboard` on this file.** Use `--check` and read
  the direction first. The tool will not stop you; it will only tell you it
  cannot tell.
- **Anything landing in bw-board's `i8086-machine.js` has to be grafted**, by
  someone who knows what the hunk does. That cost compounds: it was four lines
  today and it will not stay four lines.
- **This is the second file in this shape.** `CircuitDesigner.jsx` is 19 ahead
  and 46 behind (see `VENDOR-DIVERGENCE-BW-CIRCUIT-UI.md`). Two is a pattern:
  vendored trees acquire local edits, and nothing warns until someone tries to
  sync.

## The general shape, for whoever meets the third one

A vendored file that is *behind* is an inconvenience — sync it. A vendored file
that is *ahead* is a fork nobody declared. A file that is **both** cannot be
resolved by any tool, because the tool has no way to know which of two changes
was the intended one. The only repair is a person who understands both sides,
and the only prevention is upstreaming local edits while they are still small
enough to remember.
