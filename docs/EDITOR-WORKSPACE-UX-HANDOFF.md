# Editor workspace delivery handoff

Updated 2026-10-29. The supplier menu work is qualified and merged. The combined Lite editor delivery is **not merged, qualified or deployed**. The operator transferred remaining integration to the Circuit maintainer on 2026-10-29; the previous coordinator stopped writes and handed over original custody.

## Current identities

- [CUI #131](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/bw-circuit-ui/pull/131) merged normally at `4b65f15485abbc039958d8e1a8a29ac3459b75f9`, tree `c07bedfe0a003c361621fbe9fb2b3a0bb9413d46`. All three exact-head checks passed. Independent original-log readback verified 83/83 scenarios, zero failures/skips, and all seven required browser/touch steps. CI and landed parents/tree matched the prediction. [Qualification run](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/bw-circuit-ui/actions/runs/40802516708).
- [Lite #1536](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/brickwright-lite/pull/1536) checkpoint `b1d4b5eadc17059feeb6a2d5d704942d51fe89b6` normally composes the complete frozen Circuit #1538 source `93aba75473e65042925928fe8c1a0a4427fd59ca`, editor source and main through `e15b7e11c8fdb0862ff73369dab50bf55ead52b8`. It explicitly adopts CUI `4b65f154`; Board remains `8785e4688cc308b34fea434c1734523caa621f74`.
- The current operator policy is fast-default qualification with no `ci:full` labels; the original label instruction is historical. Combined [Build run 40822785950](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/brickwright-lite/actions/runs/40822785950) was pending at this checkpoint. Refresh the actual final head and checks before acting; no queued result is acceptance.

## Implemented source

- FPGA: Design/Build/Simulate workspaces, selectors in place of button walls, labelled information popovers and a show/hide minimap. Hidden workspaces retain editor state; diagnostics and unsupported boundaries remain visible.
- Paint/vector: one horizontally scrolling command band with Fill/Outline/width first, numeric hover/accessibility labels, one scrolling tool column, uniformly scaled regular polygons/stars. The standalone exported-SVG reader checks geometry independently; actual draw/export/save/reopen acceptance remains required.
- Pixel: compact foreground/background/swap controls and a 4-by-4 colour popover with touch-sized swatches and keyboard navigation.
- Code: grouped Robot-style overflow popup, keyboard file opening and persistent native file input. File/Edit menus expose real active-editor callbacks for Pixel/Tilemap, vector, sound, Robot and Circuit, with currentness/selection/availability guards and checked switches.
- Robot: Program connection already landed in Manual controls through #1487. All supported Brick buttons now use that folded section. The obsolete program-scanning detector and only its three utility tests were retired after a separate reachability audit; active Manual-controls and delivery/release assertions remain.
- Circuit: grouped accessible supplier menus and the host descriptor bridge. Canonical pin writer and npm-derived CUI integrity update both package declarations/locks; notice licence bytes match the landed source. This is metadata preparation, **not installed-package acceptance**.

## Failures preserved and bounded forward repairs

Previous editor head `8dcf060` failed unit shards 1/4/6, Build and browser light/heavy; its successful FPGA/Robot jobs do not qualify a different head. Retain those originals and their declared TODO/skip boundaries.

The new checkpoint records the actual generated menu translation catalogue, fixes the current Code-popup test double/source contract, follows Circuit popups by their originating trigger's `aria-controls`, opens File through its real button, and opens Pixel brush settings through the compact picker. It corrects a method extractor that accidentally included `componentDidUpdate`, preserving all 36 connection controls. Twenty-one focused menu/geometry/controller controls pass. A narrow static audit of 43 owned changed scripts/tests reports no gate-shape findings; the complete CI audit is still required. Local Manual-controls DOM tests could not load React in this worktree; the failure is retained, with no dependency installation or full local build.

## Continue in this order

The x86 owner released the producer identity hold after comparing the exact current candidate. The changed `CUI` constant is used only by the live adopted-dependency check; no consumed profile, source guard, budget or reader changed. Preserve the distinction when later composing the separate F10 work: historical globals stay historical, while only its current identity map and reviewed witnesses advance. This review does not qualify an actual guest run.

1. **Finish the known real browser failures.** Retained light-job evidence at the old head shows: Paint workspace exceeds a tablet viewport; the right-pane toggle intercepts the Pixel-opening button; the independent-handle journey uses an obsolete Finish-path lookup; bitmap rotation remains disabled after its selection; Code horizontal-menu navigation needs its actual focus state diagnosed; a micro:bit catalogue click is intercepted. Confirm each cause against current source/build, fix the owning UI/controller boundary, and preserve every image, transform, save/reopen, view/hit-testing and numerical assertion. Do not add retries, force clicks or larger timeouts to conceal these failures. Current phone/File and Pixel brush lookup repairs still need actual browser acceptance.
2. **Read the new combined qualification once.** The Circuit campaign owner retains numerical unit 2/3/6 intake and independent readers; give that owner the exact head, CUI pin, run and job IDs before numerical acquisition/readback. The x86 owner retains the old heavy-job benchmark original and diagnosis. Reuse retained originals; do not download whole-run logs that duplicate another owner's custody. Root owns combined GUI/artifact qualification.
3. **Complete actual application acceptance.** Exercise wide/narrow Paint and Pixel, all File/Edit/overflow menus by mouse and keyboard, Code file input close/reopen, FPGA workspace state/minimap, regular SVG geometry plus SB3 save/reopen, Manual controls input/release, and packaged Circuit/ADC/rearm/HOLD/refusal controls. Installed root/GUI package identity and notices must pass hosted provenance gates. Preserve all enabled checks; no source merge on focused host tests alone.
4. **Land only a qualified final candidate.** Require every enabled exact-final-head check SUCCESS, with only declared skips. Merge normally with a matched head and verify actual parents/tree against a fresh prediction. Close #1538 only after its entire source is preserved and qualified in main. Return the qualified main SHA/tree proof to the Robot owner before it composes foreign pins. Circuit campaign audit/final documentation remains with its owner.
5. **Deploy and inspect production.** Observe existing production runs before any single dispatch of `.github/workflows/deploy-daily.yml`. Deploy qualified current main through that guarded workflow; verify the live version contains the combined UX/Circuit source, then inspect real wide/narrow menus and editor layouts. Update this handoff with exact landed/deployed identities and any remaining limitations.

## Pin and evidence roles

`CONTRACT_SOURCES` in `scripts/lib/instrument-regression-cases.mjs` and its matching regression-workflow checkout are live source identities and advance with the package. Current adoption assertions advance too. The four sealed reference-qualified v2 workflow/profile/reader/receipt files remain byte-identical to frozen #1538. Do not create a new seal for ordinary live source, rewrite a consumed study to today's pins, replay its cohort/reader or relabel old results as combined acceptance.

Keep original v1 incomplete/failed boundaries, v2 measured identities, LM741 pending limits, magnitude-only long-capture scope, untested capture-size boundary and unsupported AC/ADC-watch cases. No physical calibration, hardware, release or broad accuracy claim is supplied by this UI work.

## Vercel incident

The incomplete `677f9bf` commit exposed a stale project-level Ignored Build Step: `bash scripts/vercel-ignore.sh`. The complete source tree was restored normally at `643f50c`; every original entry was independently compared. The script is intentionally absent. The obsolete project command was removed and fresh API reads confirmed it is null, preserving build/install/runtime settings; 21 existing deployment-policy controls pass. Repository Git-triggered deployment remains disabled in favour of the guarded workflow.

Production still reports `5cd027707eceed3451bd62eaa21125a051650e59` at `https://brickwright-lite.vercel.app/brickwright-version.json`. The configuration defect is fixed; **a fresh production deployment and live UX acceptance remain outstanding**. Do not retry the incomplete commit, add a dummy ignore script or bypass qualification.

Use hosted CI or a capable worker for builds and suites. Keep operator paths, credentials, raw receipts and session coordination in ignored private notes.

## Forward repair checkpoint — 2026-10-29

The original `b1d4b5e` Build was cancelled and its scientific jobs did not
complete. Other same-head runs are distinct events; do not borrow identities
or treat cancelled/skipped checks as acceptance. Preserve original-reader
bindings and freeze each final head/run/job before any new original intake.

Prepared repairs keep the catalogue in the Code popup's scroll flow, reserve
the pane-toggle footprint in the Costume command band without adding another
phone chrome row, and focus an empty menu so Escape reaches its close handler.
The browser oracle now requires actual menu dismissal as well as focus return.
Fifteen tiny keyboard/phone source controls pass; omitting empty-menu focus is
rejected and restoration passes. This is not actual browser qualification.

Two retained-log diagnoses were corrected: the catalogue chip was outside the
viewport, and Finish path still exists when a draft exists. Bitmap rotation
correctly refuses without an actual selection. Keep those guards and selectors.
Tablet controllers read current canvas bounds after tool changes and report
real hit/selection state; Paint overflow reports ancestor bounds before its
unchanged assertion. The old log supplied no measured Paint width, so no
universal layout cause or closure is claimed before fresh browser evidence.

The old heavy wrapper failed the initial-JavaScript budget: 4,493,574 bytes
against 4,476,352, an excess of 17,222. It did not reach runtime benchmarking.
The transferred retained stats are the source for a dependency-boundary repair;
keep the budget and qualify the corrected artifact. Native Rust lockstep work
has a separate owner. No performance, calibration or deployment claim follows.

The bundle candidate defers the shared Library presentation, with the original
implementation moved byte-for-byte to its sibling module. The Circuit runtime
host stays eager: delaying it would lose nonretained events and synchronous
save handling. Library callers already mount only when their modal is open;
no static member or imperative consumer was found. A cancellable loader refuses
old completions, reports load failures and starts a new request on retry. Its
seven pure controls pass; an omitted stale-completion guard is detected and
restoration passes. Combined with keyboard/phone controls, 22 tiny checks pass.
The existing chrome journey now checks no pre-open library request, real loading,
known-item filtering, close/reopen state and one actual sprite addition with
costumes. These are prepared acceptance assertions, not executed GUI results.
Hosted stats still must establish the actual unchanged size budget.

## Current qualification policy and measured GUI return

The operator explicitly requested no `ci:full` PR labels. Preserve fast build,
unit, corpus and other enabled checks together with actual affected production
acceptance. Do not repeat label changes: external removal cancelled the old
thorough selection before it supplied application evidence. The legacy
label-only verdict conflicts with the current policy; PR1558 scopes admission
of actual selected fast/thorough execution without changing any test, selector,
main/dispatch behavior, budget or numerical bound. It must not turn an empty
code-tier attempt into qualification. Shared protocol-document ownership stays
with its existing owner; this handoff records the current direction.

The GUI owner measured a 1024-pixel ancestor at the 834-pixel Paint viewport.
Its returned patch limits only the hidden-stage Costume pane to `100vw`, leaving
the global floor intact. Pixel’s nonshrinking tool strip placed Save at x=1117;
allowing that strip to shrink brought it to x=822 in the bounded observation.
Mirror is reached through its real colour popover. A captured focus trace also
showed the next key arriving before scheduled File-menu focus; the driver now
waits for that precondition without changing its timeout or navigation assertions.
The new request witness uses `globalThis.URL`, fixing a real proof-address
shadow; its executed regression reproduces the old failure. Twenty-four local
pure controls pass. The owner’s broader development-mode journeys and focused
controls are useful bounded evidence, not final production/source qualification.
Production readback, flag-on FPGA and emitted-budget verification are still owed.
