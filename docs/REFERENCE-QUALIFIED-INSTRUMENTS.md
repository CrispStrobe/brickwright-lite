# Reference-qualified teaching-circuit instruments

This document defines the authored teaching-circuit study and its retained-
original readback method. Manifest counts describe candidates; actual outcomes
require an admitted run at its exact source and independent original readback.
This methods page supplies no numerical or physical qualification by itself.

## Retained first-study result and held correction

The original v1 study at source `92a9ab6e7e4c639fb43299451a974c6a700592d3`,
[run 40335666363](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/brickwright-lite/actions/runs/40335666363),
failed and remains unchanged. One acquired original artifact and the frozen
independent reader establish an incomplete report: 23 of 32 designs numerically
passed, with all 3,726 compared values agreeing. Nine unsuccessful requests stay
in the full denominator. Nine of 15 requested scope/DMM designs and 59 of 84
virtual selector locations passed. These are authored native inputs, not
foreign-format imports or physical calibration. The failed head is not qualified.

Six LM741 requests used 10 MHz against the existing 2 MHz CLI limit. Two nonlinear
networks were refused by conservative DC reachability. The LT1763 named refusal
was correct, but the harness incorrectly expected exit 1 instead of 2. The rate
and exit-code mistakes belong to the harness. No voltage/current disagreement
was observed among the23 compared designs; the nine others have no such result.

The local v2 correction retains the 20 µs op-amp observation window,
20 ns maximum solver step and every numerical tolerance. It requests 40 samples
at 2 MHz instead of 200 at 10 MHz, validates rate/clock consistency before selection,
and requires the exact named refusal exit 2. It has a distinct, unselected study
identity; the original v1 ref is never reused. Its supplier pin/domain admission
is still pending the separately claimed junction-reachability repair. **Do not
select this provisional v2 plan before that qualified package adoption.**
The forward reference admission also derives TEMP and TNOM from the admitted
[ngspice 42 constants](https://github.com/imr/ngspice/blob/ngspice-42/src/include/ngspice/const.h).
The earlier modern-SI conversion produced a reference thermal voltage about
8.77 nV below the declared 25.85 mV. Version42 requires 26.826895261366076 °C
for that declared law; equal TEMP/TNOM preserves the authored saturation currents.
A source control checks every DC reference card and rejects the old conversion.
This corrects reference conditions before selection, without changing numerical
bounds or reinterpreting v1 results. It does not explain the supplier's separate
tail-pair failure: that test already uses the version42-matched temperature.

The NPN reference now explicitly ties each fourth substrate terminal to its
collector. These authored models have zero base/collector series resistance and
no substrate law; an omitted fourth pin in ngspice 42 instead implies ground.
Supplier diagnostics identified the resulting extra GMIN current, independently
explained by the [version42 parser](https://github.com/imr/ngspice/blob/ngspice-42/src/spicelib/parser/inp2q.c)
and [BJT current reporting](https://github.com/imr/ngspice/blob/ngspice-42/src/spicelib/devices/bjt/bjtask.c).
All DC references explicitly retain the model's 1 pS junction conductance and
disable numerical shunt, GMIN-stepping and source-stepping fallbacks. The declared
DC sweep still uses its ordinary point-to-point continuation. Failure to solve
remains an unsuccessful comparison, never permission to add a grounding resistor
or normalize output. Source controls reject the old implicit substrate topology;
all native circuit graphs, numerical bounds and previous originals are unchanged.

No v2 numerical result is claimed, and source/mock controls do not supply one.

## Frozen candidate scope

The manifest in `scripts/lib/reference-qualified-circuits.mjs` defines 32
independently authored BSD-3-Clause native JSON inputs. Its 31 numerical candidates have
distinct terminal-coloured topology signatures after ignoring component values,
names, positions and passive-lead orientation. Different signatures establish
different graphs, not electrical non-equivalence or physical accuracy.

| Family | Candidate designs | Route and comparison |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Divider, loaded potentiometer, loaded bridge, summing mixer, R-2R ladder | 5 | Static strict DC transfer versus SPICE |
| Loaded RC/RL, band-pass, pi, twin-T and RLC networks | 8 | Precision scope samples and DMM means versus SPICE transient |
| Half-wave, bridge, clipper, diode OR and biased clamp | 5 | Static explicit-Shockley transfer versus SPICE |
| Common emitter/base, emitter follower, differential pair and Darlington | 5 | Static explicit transistor models versus SPICE |
| LM741 follower, inverting/non-inverting, summer, difference and Sallen-Key | 6 | Explicit nominal linear-pole captures versus a separate SPICE realization |
| Zener shunt and admitted direct-RC ADP7118 startup | 2 | Static breakdown / nominal startup-envelope comparisons |
| LT1763 precision-domain refusal | 1 control | Named refusal before capture; excluded from qualified-design counts |

Thus 16 designs request static analysis and 15 request actual precision
scope/DMM captures. A static transfer test does not establish rectifier waveforms
or instrument capture behavior. The twin-T and RLC cases exercise transient
responses; this cohort does not claim a frequency-response sweep.

All inputs, node/probe locations, source conditions, clocks, observation types,
reference decks, model parameters and tolerances are fixed before execution.
The collector preserves failed, disagreeing, refused and missing cases in the
same denominator. Acquisition completeness and numerical conformance are
separate verdicts. Requested capture-design counts, numerically passing capture
designs and recorded CLI attempts are also separate. A recorded attempt can
refuse before simulation; it does not count as a successful circuit test. A
complete failing report does not qualify its circuits.

## Source and method admission

The prepared v2 study source contract is `bw-board`
`c7bcbe4bcd583d2215372dd4ee1e65002e249a04` and `bw-circuit-ui`
`da28bb8ce9b38aa18d2e424f692c6570fc1d6d1d`, the suppliers Lite main pins.
They replace the earlier prepared `dfa4be8e`/`66e37240` binding through a fresh
source admission recorded in the harness lane. The package return leg owns dependency pin changes; this harness
only binds its exact, separately qualified supplier identities. Before numerical work, the collector compares both installed npm
payloads to their exact owned Git sources, verifies that the UI resolves the
sibling engine, and checks the independently admitted JS/JSON fingerprints.
The retained UI package manifest is independently byte-bound to its own pinned
source; its declared dependency metadata and observed runtime identity remain
separate.
This is not verification of arbitrary dependencies or a hermetic-execution claim.

These are qualified supplier revisions, not a claim that Lite has adopted them
or that v2 has run. The separately owned package return must first qualify its
actual installed packages and affected GUI. Final source and reader admission
then precedes the one selected v2 event. The failed v1 run and its original
reader retain their old source identities and outcomes.

Before numerical work, the actual CLI must convert each native input to a
retained `loaded.json`. Its complete parts, model parameters, wires and supply
must equal the frozen authored input. Measurements use that exact retained file.
Capture receipts additionally bind its imported-graph digest. Static DC has no
receipt API: its boundary is the retained input, observed full CLI load and exact
native identity-loader source, not an internal MNA execution transcript. This
cohort establishes no foreign-format importer coverage or imported-corpus total.

The independent reference executable must identify itself as ngspice 42. Its
[version-42 manual](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs/ngspice-42-manual.pdf)
documents the shared-scale, named-vector `wrdata` output used here. Raw reference
rows and uniformly sampled rows are retained separately. Static sweeps require
converged strict native solutions at every source value. The reference retains
ngspice's ordinary point-to-point DC sweep continuation; its numerical fallbacks
are disabled. Transient references use explicit
zero-state initialization, a finite source edge and a bounded maximum step.
No DC operating-point bias is substituted for the transient initial state.

Native current-source parameters are mapped explicitly to the opposite SPICE
card direction: the differential pair's tail draws current from its emitter net.

DC terminal current is positive **into** the named terminal; instrument current
is positive **out of** the part. Scope values are instantaneous samples. DMM
values are observed means over the whole declared window. The reader compares
those means to quadrature over the retained adaptive SPICE rows, with the
frozen small initial-gap extension stated in each case. That extension is not
presented as an observed time-zero sample or an independent integral certificate.

The LM741 reference includes differential input resistance, finite output
resistance and the nominal dominant-pole equation. It does not represent a
vendor transistor macromodel, input bias or rail quiescent current. The ADP7118
reference separately expresses the admitted startup/current-limit envelope;
the reference includes the model's one-sided current clamp and quiescent-current law.
The direct-RC topology is already supported; this case uses a distinct load and
SPICE/batch observation intent, and makes no new-domain or novel-topology claim.
Neither establishes
physical calibration, noise, thermal behavior or device-wide accuracy.

## Execution and retained-original readback

Printing the candidate manifest runs no simulator:

```sh
node scripts/reference-qualified-instrument-study.mjs --manifest
node --max-old-space-size=384 --test test/reference-qualified-instrument-study.test.mjs
```

Source controls use the installed locked UI manifest. An isolated checkout can
set `REFERENCE_UI_PACKAGE_JSON` to the exact pinned UI source manifest; its bytes
are checked before synthetic controls. No simulator is imported for that check.

The workflow `reference-qualified-instruments.yml` runs source controls for
changes to this harness. Only the separately admitted frozen
`study/reference-qualified-v2` push may select the actual experiment. An exact
head, intent, source/reference/reader review and one-shot event check are required
before that push. The reviewed head is recorded in the separate repository
variable
`REFERENCE_QUALIFIED_STUDY_HEAD`; a mismatched or missing value refuses before setup.
The original admission record is retained and joined by the independent reader.
Ordinary source pushes, unrelated labels and dispatches do not
run the experiment. No study is started just to populate a workflow census.

CLI and reference commands run sequentially with a 90-second CPU/wall limit, 16 MiB file limit,
8 MiB captured-output limit, and a 60-minute monotonic cohort budget checked
between commands and after each case; each subprocess receives at most the
remaining cohort wall allowance. The whole hosted job has a 75-minute
timeout, including package installation and source verification. The collector
also limits total retained bytes. Those are experiment bounds; existing engine
precision limits and refused domains are preserved. The study cannot overwrite
an earlier output directory.

The standalone `scripts/read-reference-qualified-instruments.py` reads retained
files, checks input/source/process/receipt identities, reconstructs comparisons,
and reconciles the complete denominator. It imports no producer module and runs
no engine, CLI, oracle or browser. Its external head/run arguments must come
from independently admitted official metadata, not from a report's self-claim:

```sh
python3 -I -B scripts/read-reference-qualified-instruments.py RETAINED_ORIGINALS \
  --head EXACT_STUDY_COMMIT --run OFFICIAL_RUN_ID
```

Exit 0 means complete originals and conforming comparisons; exit 2 preserves a
complete numerical disagreement or incomplete outcome; exit 3 rejects invalid
or inconsistent originals. Synthetic source controls test these distinctions,
including coherent byte-receipt mutations, wrong current signs, time grids,
DMM units/windows, source identities and changed expectations. They do not count
as simulated circuits or numerical qualification.

Observed counts, official run identity, independent readback and limits belong
to the [instrument campaign status](CIRCUIT-INSTRUMENT-REGRESSION.md). The reader
reports all 32 case verdicts, requested and passing selector locations, and
bounded failed-value examples. These selector locations are named virtual
observations, not claims of physical probe insertion or independent placements. Existing studies retain
their original identities and outcomes; they are not rerun or relabelled here.

Setup failures retain the full not-run denominator and source/event bindings.
Independent readback distinguishes this incomplete outcome from malformed
originals; it does not establish the recorded failure's cause or qualify any
measurements. A claimed setup failure cannot conceal retained case execution.
