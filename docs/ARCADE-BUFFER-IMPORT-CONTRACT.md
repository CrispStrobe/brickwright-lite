# Buffer import integration contract

Read this after `ARCADE-AGENT-HANDOFF.md`, `ARCADE-PARTIAL-CLOSURE-PLAN.md`
and the current `LANES.md`. Buffer runtime/export authoring exists in PR810;
E10 retains importer and expression/type-lowering ownership. This contract is
preparation, not a claim that namespace Buffer imports already work.

## Lower existing AST expressions to native values

Use genuine Buffer values, never a string substitute for shared mutable storage.
The parser already represents tagged hex as `Template` with `tag === 'hex'`.
The current `music.createSong` importer accepts inline literals or an immediate
`Buffer.fromHex` call; it still diagnoses arbitrary Buffer variables. Preserve
named-song resource metadata on the existing inline/resource route.

| Original API | Native opcode | Required value semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `control.createBuffer(size)` | `arcade_createBuffer` | Fresh mutable buffer |
| `Buffer.fromUTF8(text)` / `control.createBufferFromUTF8(text)` | `arcade_bufferFromUTF8` | Fresh mutable UTF8 bytes; original surrogate replacement, byte bound before encoding |
| `Buffer.fromHex(text)` | `arcade_bufferFromHex` | Fresh mutable decode; preserve odd-length original behavior |
| `hex` tagged template | `arcade_bufferLiteral` | Readonly literal; same source site reuses identity, different sites stay distinct |
| `buffer.isReadOnly()` | `arcade_bufferIsReadOnly` | Original Boolean readonly state; aliases retain it, detached slices become mutable |
| `buffer.concat(other)` | `arcade_bufferConcat` | Detached fresh mutable result; bound combined allocation before creation |
| `buffer.equals(other)` | `arcade_bufferEquals` | Original content equality Boolean; explicit null equality is supported by runtime, foreign/stale references still diagnose |
| `buffer.indexOf(other)` | `arcade_bufferIndexOf` | Original first byte-match index / -1, including empty needles and out-of-range zero reads |
| `Buffer.fromArray(numbers)` | `arcade_bufferFromArray` | Fresh mutable bytes; numeric array remains detached; original byte coercion |
| `buffer.toArray(format)` | `arcade_bufferToArray` | Fresh scoped number array; all16 formats; ignore trailing incomplete numbers |
| `Buffer.concat(buffers)` | `arcade_bufferConcatArray` | Fresh mutable detached buffer; readonly inputs stay untouched; total-byte bound |
| `buffer.length` | `arcade_bufferLength` | Byte count, not Scratch string length |
| `buffer[index]` | `arcade_bufferGetByte` | Original byte read and bounds |
| `buffer[index] = value` | `arcade_bufferSetByte` | Mutate shared storage; evaluate receiver/index/value once in source order |
| `Buffer.sizeOfNumberFormat(format)` | `arcade_bufferFormatSize` | Original16 format sizes; dynamic enums and invalid numeric formats return original zero |
| `buffer.getNumber(format, offset)` | `arcade_bufferGetNumber` | All16 original integer/float formats |
| `buffer.setNumber(format, offset, value)` | `arcade_bufferSetNumber` | Original byte order, signedness and static-buffer behavior |
| `buffer.slice(offset, length)` | `arcade_bufferSlice` | Detached copy; second argument is length |
| `buffer.write(offset, source)` | `arcade_bufferWrite` | Shared source, overlapping writes retain original behavior |
| `buffer.fill(value, offset, length)` | `arcade_bufferFill` | Preserve original defaults and clipping |
| `buffer.shift(amount, offset, length)` | `arcade_bufferShift` | Original shift direction/range |
| `buffer.rotate(amount, offset, length)` | `arcade_bufferRotate` | Original rotation direction/range |
| `buffer.toHex()` | `arcade_bufferToHex` | Encode current bytes |
| `buffer.toString()` | `arcade_bufferToText` | Decode UTF8 from current bytes |
| `music.createSong(buffer)` | `arcade_songFromBuffer` | Song keeps the actual buffer; later mutation affects playback |

The canonical FORMAT slot is a reporter input with a native `bufferFormats`
dropdown. Lower named `NumberFormat` members to the menu, preserving the exact
original enum values for dynamic reporters. Numeric strings arriving from the
Scratch string slot must resolve to numeric enum IDs, not reverse enum labels.
Neither `NumberFormat` nor `Buffer` may bypass local shadowing checks.

## Scope, typing and initialization

1. Record a Buffer type for namespace/global/local declarations, procedure
   arguments/results and array elements. Distinguish indexed Buffer byte access
   from ordinary reference-array access. Preserve aliases through assignments,
   closures, custom blocks and arrays; a copied slice gets a separate identity.
2. Namespace constants containing hex are executable initializer values, not
   image resources or guessed strings. Retain namespace names, declaration
   order, referenced initializers and once-only initialization. Honor shadowing.
3. Route Buffer operations after receiver type resolution. Unknown receivers,
   unsupported constructors/formats and unsupported syntax keep named diagnostics.
   Do not promote a program merely because its bytes were extracted as a constant.
4. Preserve readonly versus mutable construction by the original operation;
   the original numeric/byte methods themselves define their exact static checks.
5. Native heap references are per project run. Project load/start/disposal drops
   the heap; serialized references cannot revive it. Source reconstructs values
   when the program runs. Export discards matching Buffer sidecar placeholders
   as initializers, emits real Buffer/Buffer[] types and rebuilds actual values.
6. A per-allocation1MiB guard exists. Aggregate collection and APIs absent from the table remain separate
   runtime/authoring gaps. UTF8 construction uses the pinned original
   TextEncoder path, with encoded-byte counting before allocation. Do not
   silently replace a refused value with an empty buffer or successful no-op.

## Required acceptance and unchanged corpus boundary

Use `test/makecode-arcade-buffer-values.test.mjs` and
`test/makecode-arcade-byte-buffer.test.mjs` as actual original-runtime controls.
`test/arcade-buffer-controller.test.mjs` verifies real native keyboard events,
Blocks/Code reconstruction and export from the VM's serialized project, including
a global named `hex` that must be renamed around the original template tag.
`scripts/verify-arcade-buffer-browser.mjs` is the hosted visible editor journey;
its source is preparation until the exact-head browser artifact proves success.

Add importer tests that start with original TypeScript, not prewritten native
Code: namespace constants, aliases, mutation, function/array flow, source-site
literal identity, readonly errors and a song played from mutated shared bytes.
Execute original PXT and native VM observables, then Code reconstruction, native
export/original execution, import again and actual SB3 fresh reopening. Test
unsupported malformed forms and shadowed names without removing diagnostics.

For authentic context qualification, use the private corpus handoff: originals,
manifest, exact companion files/dependencies and immutable input hashes. Keep
original snippets and project-context results separate. The three Pizza-related
originals listed in the partial plan additionally have missing assets and APIs;
Buffer support alone is not whole-game equivalence. Never invent those inputs.

Last full immutable184-input census:142translated/41partial/1parsefailure.
Authenticated41-context checkpoint:7translated/33partial/1Code-to-Blocks
parsefailure. Rerun both with identical inputs after integration and report changed
diagnostics and observed execution separately. Do not call either count a number
of proven failing games. Do not change denominators to achieve zero partials.

## Public API scope and remaining Buffer authoring gaps

Validate against `base/buffer.ts` and `base/shims.d.ts` in the pinned original
`packages/scratch-gui/static/makecode/arcade/target.json`, then compile and execute
an original fixture before adding a native word. Simulator internals alone are
not the public API. The original `Buffer.write` declaration takes exactly
`dstOffset, src`; its simulator implementation has additional internal arguments
that the compiler rejects. Keep the existing two-argument write. To select a
source fragment, use the public `slice(offset, length)` operation and write that
copy. Do not export four-argument `write` calls.

Actual public declarations still needing runtime/native authoring/export work:

| Public API | Required work beyond the existing Buffer foundation |
| --- | --- |
| `Buffer.create(size)` | Import alias for the existing allocator; resolve shadowing |
| `getUint8` / `setUint8` | Import aliases for byte reads/writes |

This is a source-derived backlog, not a claim these calls occur in every partial
corpus app. Every implementation needs original execution, native value/alias
controls, Blocks/Code, typed export and actual SB3 reopening; importer work stays
with E10. Aggregate Buffer collection remains a separate host-resource task.

### Format-size authoring continuation

`arcade byte buffer number format UInt16BE size` returns2; a reporter in the
FORMAT slot supports computed numeric enums. The native menu retains all16
original formats. Public `Buffer.sizeOfNumberFormat` is extracted from the same
pinned target source as the existing helpers, with source hashes and exact
regeneration. Export emits the genuine static API and preserves numeric function
returns. Invalid numeric formats retain the original zero result. Import alias
resolution and visible editor qualification remain separate acceptance tasks.

Run the affected controls with the exact producer pin:

```sh
node --import ./scripts/lib/register-gui-scope.mjs --test test/makecode-arcade-buffer-format-size.test.mjs test/makecode-arcade-buffer-values.test.mjs test/makecode-arcade-byte-buffer.test.mjs test/lego-spike-roundtrip.test.mjs
node scripts/generate-arcade-buffer-helpers.mjs --check
node scripts/generate-arcade-authoring-inventory.mjs --check
```

### Number-array and static concatenation continuation

Native words are `arcade byte buffer from number array ARRAY`, `arcade byte
buffer BUFFER to number array format FORMAT`, and `arcade concatenate byte
buffers in array ARRAY`. Their inputs/outputs use the existing session-scoped
array heap; runtime wrappers refuse foreign or expired arrays. JSON fixed finite
number-array constructors now export to real numeric array literals; negative
zero is retained in source. Other unsupported constructor forms keep diagnostics.
Use reference-array mutation with a numeric reporter (for example `convert value
(77) op "+"`), since unwrapped inputs in the Arrays block are text.

The original algorithms are selected directly from the consumed target bundle.
Six Buffer reads and one write adapt indexed access to original getByte/setByte
shims; ordinary number-array reads remain ordinary array reads. Both directions
copy storage. Static concat copies bytes, even for one input or readonly literals.
The original decoder has a zero-size infinite loop for invalid formats; the host
refuses that input before invocation with a named diagnostic. Never run it as a
positive original-runtime case. Per-buffer1MiB and input-array element guards
remain; aggregate heap collection/resources remain separate gaps.

```sh
node --import ./scripts/lib/register-gui-scope.mjs --test test/makecode-arcade-buffer-arrays.test.mjs test/makecode-arcade-buffer-format-size.test.mjs test/makecode-arcade-byte-buffer.test.mjs test/lego-spike-roundtrip.test.mjs test/dialect-arcade-import-lines.test.mjs
```

This is native authoring/export source, not namespace Buffer import or visible
GUI qualification. Keep corpus classifications until actual immutable recensus.

### Base64 construction and encoding continuation

Native words are `arcade byte buffer from Base64 text TEXT` and `arcade byte
buffer BUFFER to Base64 text`. Export emits genuine `Buffer.fromBase64` and
`.toBase64`, preserving dynamic strings and literal numeric text. Constructed
buffers are mutable; encoding a readonly literal preserves its bytes and flag.
Foreign or expired references, non-string construction and malformed input emit
named errors rather than successful empty values.

The generator selects the original alphabet, encoder, parser and constructor
from the consumed MIT `base/buffer.ts`. It now checks nine Buffer indexed reads,
four indexed writes and ten string indexed reads. String indexing adapts to
PXT `String_.charAt`: incomplete groups can yield zero-filled trailing bytes.
Preserve that original behavior, URL-safe input and original padding validation;
a standard Base64 library is not an equivalent replacement. The original scan
calculates the exact allocation under the existing1MiB buffer guard. A separate
input scan bound permits every accepted group up to the output limit. Aggregate
heap lifetime and a visible byte/encoding inspector remain separate gaps.

```sh
node --import ./scripts/lib/register-gui-scope.mjs --test test/makecode-arcade-buffer-base64.test.mjs test/makecode-arcade-buffer-arrays.test.mjs test/makecode-arcade-buffer-format-size.test.mjs test/lego-spike-roundtrip.test.mjs test/dialect-arcade-import-lines.test.mjs
node scripts/generate-arcade-buffer-helpers.mjs --check
node scripts/generate-arcade-authoring-inventory.mjs --check
```

Namespace import stays with E10; native authoring/export controls cannot promote
immutable original apps or establish visible editor qualification by themselves.

### Buffer chunking continuation

Native words are `arcade byte buffer BUFFER chunks of at most SIZE bytes` and
`arcade UTF8 text TEXT byte buffer chunks of at most SIZE bytes`. They return
existing scoped array references containing Buffer references. Custom Buffer[]
returns, array indexing and static concatenation retain typed MakeCode export
through genuine `.chunked` and `Buffer.chunkedFromUTF8`. E10 retains namespace
import and shared type helper ownership.

The original `bufferChunked` returns `[source]` when it fits: preserve reference
identity and its readonly flag. Several chunks are detached mutable slices.
Fractional sizes retain the original indexed-slice behavior. Nonempty byte
buffers with nonpositive/NaN sizes are refused before the original nonprogressing
loop. Empty-buffer branches retain the original result.

The original UTF8 chunker uses UTF16 string offsets, a binary search and signed
`Math.idiv`; it may split surrogate pairs and encode each half as replacement
bytes. Preserve observed original output instead of substituting a Unicode
code-point chunker. Text and size values are passed through the original selected
functions with the existing bounded UTF8 constructor. NaN/undefined sizes that
would never progress are refused; original sizes below3 retain their error.

Per-buffer1MiB and UTF8 input1MiB code-unit limits apply. Both output collections
are limited to65536 chunks. The generator checks exactly two collection pushes
and adapts them to reserve before invoking the next chunk allocation; exceeding
the limit produces a named error, never a successful truncated collection.
Aggregate live heap collection and a visible byte/chunk inspector remain open.

```sh
node --import ./scripts/lib/register-gui-scope.mjs --test test/makecode-arcade-buffer-chunking.test.mjs test/makecode-arcade-buffer-arrays.test.mjs test/makecode-arcade-buffer-format-size.test.mjs test/makecode-arcade-byte-buffer.test.mjs test/lego-spike-roundtrip.test.mjs test/dialect-arcade-import-lines.test.mjs
node scripts/generate-arcade-buffer-helpers.mjs --check
node scripts/generate-arcade-authoring-inventory.mjs --check
```

Original comparisons, native Code/Blocks reconstruction, Buffer[] custom returns,
typed exported execution and actual fresh SB3 are controls. Visible editor and
whole original-project recensus remain separate qualification tasks.

### Packing and unpacking continuation

Native words are `arcade byte buffer packed format FORMAT size`, `arcade pack
number array ARRAY as byte buffer format FORMAT`, `arcade unpack byte buffer
BUFFER format FORMAT at OFFSET`, and `arcade pack number array ARRAY into byte
buffer BUFFER at OFFSET format FORMAT`. The array inputs/outputs use existing
scoped number[] references; foreign/expired references are refused. Export emits
genuine `Buffer.packedSize`, `Buffer.pack`, `.unpack` and `.packAt`, with Buffer
and number[] custom-return types through existing exporter constraints. E10
retains namespace import and shared type helper ownership.

The generator retains original `base/buffer.ts` parsing and field selection.
Supported field characters are `B b H h I i L l f d` and padding `x`, with
decimal repeats and endian controls `< = > !`. A space resets to little endian
as the original parser does. Unsupported characters retain the source-level
message. This is the consumed MakeCode format language; do not substitute the
full Python struct grammar or quietly accept unsupported formats.

Padding in newly packed storage starts at zero; padding in `packAt` retains
existing bytes. Extra numeric inputs are ignored and missing fields retain
original undefined coercion. Pack results and unpack arrays detach from input
storage. Original readonly and offset behavior come from the retained Buffer
shim. Erroring writes may retain a successfully written prefix: this API does
not promise transactional mutation.

Formats are limited to4096 code units, each repeat and total field work to
1048576 steps, and unpack output to1048576 numeric values. The original loop
has checked repeat/work boundaries and a reserved result push before reading
the next number. Padding-only sizes remain scalar results even above1MiB;
allocating that size still fails the existing per-buffer bound. No failure
returns a successful truncated result. Aggregate heap limits and a visible
format/byte/array inspector remain separate tasks.

```sh
node --import ./scripts/lib/register-gui-scope.mjs --test test/makecode-arcade-buffer-packing.test.mjs test/makecode-arcade-buffer-chunking.test.mjs test/makecode-arcade-buffer-arrays.test.mjs test/makecode-arcade-buffer-format-size.test.mjs test/makecode-arcade-byte-buffer.test.mjs test/lego-spike-roundtrip.test.mjs test/dialect-arcade-import-lines.test.mjs
node scripts/generate-arcade-buffer-helpers.mjs --check
node scripts/generate-arcade-authoring-inventory.mjs --check
```

Required controls compare actual original bytes/numbers, endian changes, repeat
counts, padding, offsets and error messages, then authored native Code/Blocks,
typed original export execution and actual fresh SB3 reopening. Visible GUI
proof and immutable project recensus remain separate acceptance criteria.

Packing failure transport and float-host boundary: the original simulator's
`control.fail` terminates with panic108; native blocks report the source-level
unsupported-character message through `BLOCKS_ERROR`. Missing float inputs keep
the original typed-array conversion of undefined. Chromium and Node can encode
different NaN payload bytes for that conversion. Exact byte controls therefore
execute the retained native facade in Chromium against the original simulator;
host controls separately check NaN values and field lengths. No fixed NaN payload
is substituted into the original algorithm.

### Original Buffer hash continuation

Native word: `arcade byte buffer BUFFER hash BITS bits`. The reporter reads the
same scoped Buffer and returns a number; it does not change bytes. Export uses
genuine `.hash(bits)` and carries numeric custom-return types. Original public
declaration is `base/shims.d.ts` in the pinned target bundle.

The implementation retains the complete `fnv1` and `hash` functions from the
pinned `arcade/sim/common-sim.js`, separately credited to pxt-common-packages.
`generate-arcade-buffers.mjs` records the unadapted functions' hash and checks
regeneration. Multiplication precedes XOR (FNV-1), widths coerce to signed32,
widths below1 return0, widths at least32 return unsigned32 and smaller widths
retain the original XOR-fold/mask expression. Do not substitute FNV-1a or a
cryptographic hash.

Required controls: original simulator byte/width matrix, readonly/mutable
reads, shared alias mutation, foreign/expired reference refusal, Blocks/Code,
numeric custom returns, typed original export execution and fresh SB3.

### Aggregate live-memory closure method

Per-buffer and per-result limits are already enforced. Native `_bufferHeap`
currently keeps strong references in `values`; discarded temporary results can
therefore accumulate until run/project reset. A cumulative allocation counter
alone would also penalize released temporaries and is not live-heap collection.

Close this in ordered steps: identify every root (variables/lists, active
reporter/custom-call frames, scoped array graphs, registered callbacks, literal
sites, song/playback objects and retained scenes); define ownership and reset
boundaries; reserve storage before each original allocator or copy; preserve
alias identity and account each backing store once; trace reachable values and
release unreachable entries without invalidating live references. Add controls
for cycles, aliasing, repeated discarded temporaries, live cross-frame values,
suspended scenes, queued playback, reset/disposal and allocation refusal before
copy. Audit aggregate arrays/images/song storage separately. No global heap
closure is claimed until all these roots and failure paths are covered.

### Buffer and song heap lifetime boundary — 2026-10-13

Each Buffer and native music registry now receives a module-local monotonic
heap namespace. A cleared registry or another Arcade instance in the same
runtime cannot reuse an issued ID for different bytes/playables. IDs remain
opaque; within-owner aliases still share their canonical reference.

Scratch VM uses `RUNTIME_DISPOSED` during `clear()` and project replacement,
not only permanent shutdown. That event suspends Buffer APIs before their
allocation bodies run, drops the Buffer registry, resets queued music and
releases playable registries. `PROJECT_START` alone cannot reopen a cleared
owner. Successful `PROJECT_LOADED` resets the world and reopens Buffer APIs.
New allocations then receive fresh heap IDs; old tokens stay invalid. Existing
sound constructors can still be invoked during that interval, but their new
registry cannot revive old playable IDs. This is not a general sound API
suspension policy.

Controls cover late allocation refusal, same-runtime owner separation,
Buffer-backed song release, queued sound cancellation and paused-caller
completion. An actual VM clear and same-VM SB3 replacement proves allocation
reopens without reviving the prior token. Existing alias/custom-return/array,
original export and original song-instruction controls remain required.

This closes reset/disposal ownership; it does not collect discarded temporary
Buffers during a live run or impose an aggregate allocation budget. Further
root inventory must include target variables/lists, thread stack frames and
`bwReturnValue`, callback captures, `_functionCalls`, suspended scene bundles,
scoped nested array graphs and `_musicValues`/private music fibers. Literal
source-site caches retain original identity until reset. Custom call arguments
can restore scoped references from JSON text; a weak byte registry alone could
lose payloads still recoverable through serialized values. Define those roots
and pins before introducing tracing or allocation reservations. Do not claim
host GC or a counter of historical allocations as complete live collection.
